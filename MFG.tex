\chapter*{Preface}\label{preface-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
Mathematics, as we all know, is the language of science, and fluency in algebraic skills has always been necessary for anyone aspiring to disciplines based on calculus. But in the information age, increasingly sophisticated mathematical methods are used in all fields of knowledge, from archaeology to zoology. Consequently, there is a new focus on the courses before calculus. The availability of calculators and computers allows students to tackle complex problems involving real data, but requires more attention to analysis and interpretation of results. All students, not just those headed for science and engineering, should develop a mathematical viewpoint, including critical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and estimation, in addition to computational skills. \emph{Modeling, Functions and Graphs} employs a variety of applications to motivate mathematical thinking.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .1 MODELING}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[MODELING]{MODELING}\label{section-1}
The ability to model problems or phenomena by algebraic expressions and equations is the ultimate goal of any algebra course. Through a variety of applications, we motivate students to develop the skills and techniques of algebra. Each chapter includes an interactive Investigation that gives students an opportunity to explore an openended modeling problem. These Investigations can be used in class as guided explorations or as projects for small groups. They are designed to show students how the mathematical techniques they are learning can be applied to study and understand new situations.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .2 Functions}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[Functions]{Functions}\label{section-2}
The fundamental concept underlying calculus and related disciplines is the notion of function, and students should acquire a good understanding of functions before they embark on their study of college-level mathematics. While the formal study of functions is usually the content of precalculus, it is not too early to begin building an intuitive understanding of functional relationships in the preceding algebra courses. These ideas are useful not only in calculus but in practically any field students may pursue. We begin working with functions in Chapter 1 and explore the different families of functions in subsequent chapters.%
\par
In all our work with functions and modeling we employ the “Rule of Four,” that all
problems should be considered using algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal methods.
It is the connections between these approaches that we have endeavored to establish in this course. At this level it is crucial that students learn to write an algebraic expression from a verbal description, recognize trends in a table of data, and
extract and interpret information from the graph of a function.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .3 Graphs}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[Graphs]{Graphs}\label{section-3}
No tool for conveying information about a system is more powerful than a graph. Yet many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more
global view. By taking advantage of graphing calculators, we examine a large number of examples and study them in more detail than is possible when every graph is plotted by hand. We can consider more realistic models in which calculations by more traditional methods are difficult or impossible.%
\par
We have incorporated graphing calculators into the text wherever they can be used to enhance understanding. Calculator use is not simply an add-on, but in many ways shapes
the organization of the material. The text includes instructions for the TI-84 graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility. We have not attempted to use all the features of the calculator or to teach calculator use for its own sake, but in all cases have let the mathematics suggest how technology should be used.%

You may have heard that mathematics is the language of science.  In fact, professionals in nearly every discipline take advantage of mathematical methods to analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change.  This process is called \terminology{mathematical modeling}.  A model is a simplified representation of reality that helps us understand a process or phenomenon.  Because it is a simplification, a model can never be completely accurate.  Instead, it should focus on those aspects of the real situation that will help us answer specific questions. Here is an example. %
\par
The world's population is growing at different rates in different nations.  Many factors, including economic and social forces, influence the birth rate.  Is there a connection between birth rates and education levels?  The figure shows the birth rate plotted against the female literacy rate in 148 countries.  Although the data points do not all lie precisely on a line, we see a generally decreasing trend:  the higher the literacy rate, the lower the birth rate.  The \terminology{regression line} provides a model for this trend, and a tool for analyzing the data.  In this chapter we study the properties of linear models and some techniques for fitting a linear model to data.%

Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment. He will be paid \textdollar{}1000 per month plus a 6\% commission on his sales. The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about \textdollar{}8000 worth of equipment per month. To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations.%

\subsection[Tables, Graphs and Equations]{Tables, Graphs and Equations}\label{subsection-1}
The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between variables.  In Investigation 1 {$\langle\langle$investigation-commission$\rangle\rangle$}, we analyzed the relationship between Delbert's sales and his income.  Starting from the verbal description of his income, we represented the relationship by a table of values, a graph, and an algebraic equation.  Each of these mathematical tools is useful in a different way.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-10}{}A \terminology{table of values} displays specific data points with precise numerical values.%
\item\hypertarget{li-11}{}A \terminology{graph} is a visual display of the data.  It is easier to spot trends and describe the overall behavior of the variables from a graph.%
\item\hypertarget{li-12}{}An \terminology{algebraic equation} is a compact summary of the model.  It can be used to analyze the model and to make predictions%
\end{enumerate}
\par
We begin our study of modeling with some examples of \terminology{linear models}.  In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools, and how each contributes to the model.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-Annelise}
Annelise is on vacation at a seaside resort.  She can rent a bicycle from her hotel for \textdollar{}3 an hour, plus a \textdollar{}5 insurance fee.  (A fraction of an hour is charged as the same fraction of \textdollar{}3.)%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-13}{}Make a table of values showing the cost, \(C\), of renting a bike for various lengths of time, \(t\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-14}{}Plot the points on a graph.  Draw a curve through the data points%
.
                        \item\hypertarget{li-15}{}Write an equation for \(C\) in terms of \(t\).%
\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-16}{}To find the cost, multiply the time by \textdollar{}3, and add the result to the \textdollar{}5 insurance fee.  For example, the cost of a 1-hour bike ride is
                            \begin{align*}
\text{Cost}\amp=(\$5\text{ insurance fee})+(\$3\text{ per hour})\times(\alert{1}\text{ hour})\\
C\amp=5+3(\alert{1})=8
\end{align*}
                            A 1-hour bike ride costs \textdollar{}8.  Record the results in a table, as shown here:%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{AcAcAcAcA}\hrulethick
Length of rental (hours)%
&Cost of rental (dollars)%
&&\((t,C)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin

3&14&\(C=5+3(\alert{3})\)&\((3,14)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\item\hypertarget{li-17}{}Each pair of values represents a point on the graph.  The first value gives the horizontal coordinate of the point, and the second value gives the vertical coordinate.  The points lie on a straight line, as shown in the figure.  The line extends infinitely in only one direction, because negative values of \(t\) do not make sense here.%

\subsection[Choosing Scales for the Axes]{Choosing Scales for the Axes}\label{subsection-2}
To draw a useful graph, we must choose appropriate scales for the axes.  They must extend far enough to show the values of the variables, and the tick marks should be equally spaced.  Usually no more than 10 or 15 tick marks are needed.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-home-price}
In 1990, the median home price in the US was \textdollar{}92,000.  The median price increased by about \textdollar{}4700 per year over the next decade.

\item\hypertarget{li-29}{} Write an equation that expresses \(P\) in terms of \(t\).%

        \begin{equation*}P=92,000+\alert{8}(4700)-129,600\end{equation*}

The increase in price is the difference of the two \(P\)-values.

The examples in this section model simple linear relationships between two variables.
Such relationships, in which the value of one variable is determined by the value of the
other, are called \terminology{functions}. We will study various kinds of functions throughout the course.%

\subsection[Definition of Function]{Definition of Function}\label{subsection-6}

    We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For example, when a physician prescribes a drug in a certain dosage, she needs to know how long the dose will remain in the bloodstream. A sales manager needs to know how the price of his product will affect its sales. A \terminology{function} is a special type of relationship between variables that allows us to make such predictions.%
\par

    Suppose it costs \textdollar{}800 for flying lessons, plus \textdollar{}30 per hour to rent a plane. If we let \(C\) represent the total cost for t hours of flying lessons, then
    \begin{equation*}C=800+305t ~~~~ (t\ge 0)\end{equation*}
    Thus, for example
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rll}
when&\(t=\alert{0}\),&\(C=800+30(\alert{0})=800\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
when&\(t=\alert{4}\),&\(C=800+30(\alert{4})=920\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
when&\(t=\alert{10}\),&\(C=800+30(\alert{10})=1100\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par

    The variable \(t\) is called the \terminology{input} or \terminology{independent} variable, and \(C\) is the \terminology{output} or \terminology{dependent} variable, because its values are determined by the value of \(t\). We can display the relationship between two variables by a table or by ordered pairs. The input variable is the first component of the ordered pair, and the output variable is the second component.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{AcAcAcA}\hrulethick
\(t\)&\(C\)&\((t,C)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(0\)&\(800\)&\((0, 800)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(4\)&\(920\)&\((4, 920)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(10\)&\(1100\)&\((10,1100)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par

    For this relationship, we can find the value \(C\) of associated with any given value of \(t\). All we have to do is substitute the value of \(t\) into the equation and solve for \(C\). The result has no ambiguity: Only one value for \(C\) corresponds to each value of \(t\). This type of relationship between variables is called a \terminology{function}. In general, we make the following definition.
%
\begin{definition}[]\label{definition-function}
Definition of Function%
\par
A \terminology{function} is a relationship between two variables for which a unique value of the \terminology{output} variable can be determined from a value of the \terminology{input} variable.
    %
\end{definition}
\par

    What distinguishes functions from other variable relationships? The definition of a function calls for a \emph{unique value}—that is, \emph{exactly one value} of the output variable corresponding to each value of the input variable. This property makes functions useful in applications because they can often be used to make predictions.

According to these data, cholesterol count is \emph{not} a function of age, because several patients who are the same age have different cholesterol levels. For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a \emph{unique} value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a person’s cholesterol count.%

\typeout{Subsection 1.2.5 Function Notation}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Function Notation]{Function Notation}\label{subsection-10}
There is a convenient notation for discussing functions. First, we choose a letter, such as \(f\), \(g\), or \(h\) (or \(F\), \(G\), or \(H\)), to name a particular function. (We can use any letter, but these are
the most common choices.) For instance, in \hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}}, the height, \(h\), of a falling algebra book is a function of the elapsed time, \(t\). We might call this function \(f\). In other words, \(f\) is the name of the relationship between the variables \(h\) and \(t\). We write 
\begin{equation*}h = f (t)\end{equation*}
which means "\(h\) is a function of \(t\), and \(f\) is the name of the function."%
\par
The new symbol \(f(t)\), read "\(f\) of \(t\)," is another name for the height, \(h\). The parentheses in the symbol \(f(t)\) do not indicate multiplication. (It would not make sense to multiply the name of a function by a variable.) Think of the symbol \(f(t)\) as a single variable that represents
the output value of the function.%
\par
With this new notation we may write
\begin{equation*}h = f (t) = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
or just
\begin{equation*}f (t) = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
instead of
\begin{equation*}h = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
to describe the function.%
\par
Perhaps it seems complicated to introduce a new symbol for \(h\), but the notation \(f(t)\) is very useful for showing the correspondence between specific values of the variables \(h\) and \(t\).
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-falling-book-2}
In \hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}}, the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of the Sears Tower is given by the equation
    \begin{equation*}h = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
We see that%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}

when \(t=1\)&&\(h=1760\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
when \(t=2\)&&\(h=1712\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par
Using function notation, these relationships can be expressed more concisely as%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
\(f(1)=1760\)& and &\(f(2)=1712\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par
which we read as "\(f\) of 1 equals 1760" and "\(f\) of 2 equals 1712." The values for the input variable, \(t\), appear \emph{inside} the parentheses, and the values for the output variable, \(h\), appear on the other side of the equation.%
\end{example}
\par
Remember that when we write \(y = f(x)\), the symbol \(f(x)\) is just another name for the output variable.%

The graph in \hyperref[fig-DJIA]{Figure~\ref{fig-DJIA}}  shows the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (the average value of the stock prices of 500 major companies) during the stock market correction of October 1987. The Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is given as a function of time during the 8 days from October 15 to October 22; that is, \(f(t)\) is the DJIA recorded at noon on day \(t\).
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth,]{images/fig-DJIA.pdf}\caption{\label{fig-DJIA}}
\end{figure}
\par
The values of the input variable, time, are displayed on the horizontal axis, and the values of the output variable, DJIA, are displayed on the vertical axis. There is no formula that gives the DJIA for a particular day; but it is still a function, defined by its graph. The value of \(f(t)\) is specified by the vertical coordinate of the point with the given t-coordinate.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-DJIA}
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-117}{}The coordinates of point \(P\) in \hyperref[fig-DJIA]{Figure~\ref{fig-DJIA}} are \((15, 2412)\). What do the coordinates tell you about the function \(f\)?\item\hypertarget{li-118}{}If the DJIA was 1726 at noon on October 20, what can you say about the graph of \(f\)?\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-119}{}The coordinates of point P tell us that \(f(15) = 2412\), so the DJIA was 2412 at noon on October 15.\item\hypertarget{li-120}{}We can say that \(f(20) = 1726\), so the point \((20, 1726)\) lies on the graph of \(f\). This point is labeled \(Q\) in \hyperref[fig-DJIA]{Figure~\ref{fig-DJIA}}.\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\par
Thus, the coordinates of each point on the graph of the function represent a pair of corresponding
values of the two variables. In general, we can make the following statement.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-125}{}To find \(g(−2)\), we look for the point with \(t\)-coordinate \(−2\). The point \((−2, 0)\) lies on the graph of \(g\), so \(g(−2) = 0\). Similarly, the point \((5, 1)\) lies on the graph, so \(g(5) = 1\).\item\hypertarget{li-126}{}We look for points on the graph with \(y\)-coordinate \(−2\). Because the points \((−5, −2)\), \((−3, −2)\), and \((3, −2)\) lie on the graph, we know that \(g(−5) = −2\), \(g(−3) = −2\), and \(g(3) = −2\). Thus, the \(t\)-values we want are \(−5\), \(−3\), and \(3\).\item\hypertarget{li-127}{}The highest point on the graph is \((1, 4)\), so the largest \(y\)-value is \(4\). Thus, the maximum value of \(g(t)\) is \(4\), and it occurs when \(t = 1\).\item\hypertarget{li-128}{}A graph is increasing if the \(y\)-values get larger as we read from left to right. The graph of \(g\) is increasing for \(t\)-values between \(−4\) and \(1\), and between \(3\) and \(5\). Thus, \(g\) is increasing on the intervals \((−4, 1)\) and \((3, 5)\).\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution.}\quad Choose several convenient values for \(x\) and evaluate the function to find the corresponding \(f(x)\)-values. For this function we cannot choose \(x\)-values less than \(−4\), because the square root of a negative number is not a real number. 
    \begin{equation*}f(\alert{−4}) =\sqrt{\alert{−4} + 4}=\sqrt{0}= 0\end{equation*}

In a function, two different outputs cannot be related to the same input. This restriction means that two different ordered pairs cannot have the same first coordinate. What does it mean for the graph of the function?%
\par
Consider the graph shown in \hyperref[fig-vertical-line-test]{Figure~\ref{fig-vertical-line-test}}a. Every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, so there is only one point on the graph for each \(x\)-value. This graph represents a function. In \hyperref[fig-vertical-line-test]{Figure~\ref{fig-vertical-line-test}}b, however, the line \(x = 2\) intersects the graph at two points, \((2, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\). Two different \(y\)-values, \(1\) and \(4\), are related to the same \(x\)-value, \(2\). This graph cannot be the graph of a function.%

For graph (c), notice the break in the curve at \(x = 2\): The solid dot at \((2, 1)\) is the only point on the graph with \(x = 2\); the open circle at \((2, 3)\) indicates that \((2, 3)\) is not a point on the graph.

\subsection[Graphical Solution of Equations and Inequalities]{Graphical Solution of Equations and Inequalities}\label{subsection-16}
The graph of an equation in two variables is just a picture of its solutions. When we read the coordinates of a point on the graph, we are reading a pair of \(x\)- and \(y\)-values that make the equation true. %

For example, the point \((2, 7)\) lies on the graph of \(y = 2x + 3\) shown in \hyperref[fig-function-graph]{Figure~\ref{fig-function-graph}} , so we know that the ordered pair \((2, 7)\) is a solution of the equation \(y = 2x + 3\). You can verify algebraically that \(x = \alert{2}\) and \(y = \alert{7}\) satisfy the equation: 
    \begin{equation*}\text{Does }~\alert{7} = 2 (\alert{2}) + 3\text{? Yes}\end{equation*}
    We can also say that \(x = 2\) is a solution of the one-variable equation \(2x + 3 = 7\). In fact, we can use the graph of \(y = 2x + 3\) to solve the equation \(2x + 3 = k\) for any value of \(k\). Thus, we can use graphs to find solutions to equations in one variable.%

Begin by locating the point \(P\) on the graph for which \(y = 150\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve}}. Now find the \(x\)-coordinate of point \(P\) by drawing an imaginary line from \(P\) straight down to the \(x\)-axis. The \(x\)-coordinate of \(P\) is \(x = 9\). Thus, \(P\) is the point \((9,150)\), and \(x = 9\) when \(y = 150\). The solution of the equation \(150 = 285 − 15x\) is \(x = 9\). You can verify the solution algebraically by substituting \(x = \alert{9}\) into the equation:%
\par
Does \(150 = 285 − 15(\alert{9})\)? %
\begin{equation*}285 − 15(\alert{9}) = 285 − 135 = 150. ~~\alert{Yes}\end{equation*}\end{example}

In a similar fashion, we can solve inequalities with a graph. Consider again the graph of \(y = 2x + 3\), shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve3]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve3}}. We saw that \(x = 2\) is the solution of the equation \(2x + 3 = 7\). When we use \(x = 2\) as the input for the function \(f(x) = 2x + 3\), the output is \(y = 7\). Which input values for \(x\) produce output values greater than \(7\)? You can see in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve3]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve3}} that \(x\)-values greater than \(2\) produce \(y\)-values greater than \(7\), because points on the graph with \(x\)-values greater than \(2\) have \(y\)-values greater than \(7\). Thus, the solutions of the inequality \(2x + 3 \gt 7\) are \(x\gt 2\). You can verify this result by solving the inequality algebraically.}%

Use the graph of \(y = 285 − 15x\) to solve the inequality \begin{equation*}285 − 15x \gt 150\end{equation*}%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We begin by locating the point \(P\) on the graph for which \(y = 150\) and \(x = 9\) (its \(x\)-coordinate). Now, because \(y = 285 − 15x\) for points on the graph, the inequality \(285 − 15x \gt 150\) is equivalent to \(y \gt 150\). So we are looking for points on the graph with \(y\)-coordinate greater than \(150\). These points are shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve-inequality]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve-inequality}}. The \(x\)-coordinates of these points are the \(x\)-values that satisfy the inequality. From the graph, we see that the solutions are \(x \lt 9\).

\par
We can also use this graphical technique to solve nonlinear equations and inequalities.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-graph-to-solve-cubic}
Use a graph of \(f(x) = −2x^3 + x^2 + 16x\) to solve the equation 
    \begin{equation*}−2x^3 + x^2 + 16x = 15\end{equation*}%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If we sketch in the horizontal line \(y = 15\), we can see that there are three points on the graph of \(f\) that have \(y\)-coordinate \(15\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve-cubic]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve-cubic}}. The \(x\)-coordinates of these points are the solutions of the equation %
\par
\begin{equation*}−2x^3 + x^2 + 16x = 15\end{equation*}
    From the graph, we see that the solutions are \(x = −3\), \(x = 1\), and approximately \(x = 2.5\). We can verify the solutions algebraically. For example, if \(x = \alert{−3}\), we have 
    \begin{align*}
        f(\alert{−3})\&−2(\alert{−3})3 + (\alert{−3})^2 + 16(\alert{−3})\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
        \&= −2(−27) + 9 − 48\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
        \&=54 + 9 − 48 = 15  
    \end{align*}
    so \(−3\) is a solution.%

    and trace along the curve to the point \((2.4680851, 15.512401)\). We are close to a solution, because the \(y\)-value is close to \(15\). Try entering \(x\)-values close to \(2.4680851\), for instance, \(x = 2.4\) and \(x = 2.5\), to find a better approximation for the solution.

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        We first locate all points on the graph that have \(y\)-coordinates greater than or equal to \(15\).

\subsection[Using Ratios for Comparison]{Using Ratios for Comparison}\label{subsection-17}
Which is more expensive, a 64-ounce bottle of Velvolux dish soap that costs \textdollar{}3.52, or a 60-ounce bottle of Rainfresh dish soap that costs \textdollar{}3.36?%
\par
You are probably familiar with the notion of comparison shopping. To decide which dish soap is the better buy, we compute the unit price, or price per ounce, for each bottle. The unit price for Velvolux is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{352 \text{ cents}}{64 \text{ ounces}}= 5.5 \text{ cents per ounce}\end{equation*}
and the unit price for Rainfresh is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{336 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ ounces}}= 5.6 \text{ cents per ounce}\end{equation*}
%
\par

    The Velvolux costs less per ounce, so it is the better buy. By computing the price of each brand for \emph{the same amount of soap}, it is easy to compare them.%
\par

    In many situations, a ratio, similar to a unit price, can provide a basis for comparison. \hyperref[example-rate-of-growth]{Example~\ref{example-rate-of-growth}} uses a ratio to measure a rate of growth.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-rate-of-growth}
Which grow faster, Hybrid A wheat seedlings, which grow 11.2 centimeters in 14 days, or Hybrid B seedlings, which grow 13.5 centimeters in 18 days?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We compute the growth rate for each strain of wheat. Growth rate is expressed as a ratio, \(\frac{\text{centimeters}}{\text{days}}\), or centimeters per day. The growth rate for Hybrid A is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{11.2 \text{ centimeters}}{14 \text{ days}}= 0.8 \text{ centimeters per day}\end{equation*}
and the growth rate for Hybrid B is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{13.5 \text{ centimeters}}{18 \text{ days}}= 0.75 \text{ centimeters per day}\end{equation*}
Because their rate of growth is larger, the Hybrid A seedlings grow faster.
\end{example}
\par

    By computing the growth of each strain of wheat seedling over the same unit of time, a single day, we have a basis for comparison. In this case, the ratio \(\frac{\text{centimeters}}{\text{day}}\) measures the rate of growth of the wheat seedlings.
%
\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-gas-mileage}

    Delbert traveled 258 miles on 12 gallons of gas, and Francine traveled 182 miles on 8 gallons of gas. Compute the ratio \(\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}\) for each car. Whose car gets the better gas mileage?
\end{exercise}
\par

    In \hyperref[exercise-gas-mileage]{Exercise~\ref{exercise-gas-mileage}}, the ratio \(\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}\) measures the rate at which each car uses gasoline. By computing the mileage for each car for the same amount of gas, we have a basis for comparison. We can use this same idea, finding a common basis for comparison, to measure the steepness of an incline.

But what exactly is steepness? It is not merely the gain in altitude, because even a gentle incline will reach a great height eventually. Steepness measures how sharply the altitude increases. An ant finds the second path more difficult, or steeper, because it rises 5 feet while the first path rises only 2 feet over the same horizontal distance.}%

To compare the steepness of two inclined paths, we compute the ratio of change in
altitude to change in horizontal distance for each path.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-steep-trail}
Which is steeper, Stony Point trail, which climbs 400 feet over a horizontal distance of 2500 feet, or Lone Pine trail, which climbs 360 feet over a horizontal distance of 1800 feet?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad For each trail, we compute the ratio of vertical gain to horizontal distance. For Stony Point trail, the ratio is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{400 \text{ feet}}{2500 \text{ feet}}= 0.16 \end{equation*}  
    and for Lone Pine trail, the ratio is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{360 \text{ feet}}{1800 \text{ feet}}= 0.20 \end{equation*} 
    Lone Pine trail is steeper, because it has a vertical gain of 0.20 foot for every foot traveled horizontally. Or, in more practical units, Lone Pine trail rises 20 feet for every 100 feet of horizontal distance, whereas Stony Point trail rises only 16 feet over a horizontal distance of 100 feet.%
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-steep-steps}

\subsection[Definition of Slope]{Definition of Slope}\label{subsection-19}

    To compare the steepness of the two trails in \hyperref[example-steep-trail]{Example~\ref{example-steep-trail}}, it is not enough to know which trail has the greater gain in elevation overall. Instead, we compare their elevation gains over the same horizontal distance. Using the same horizontal distance provides a basis for comparison. The two trails are illustrated in \hyperref[fig-trail-climb-grid]{Figure~\ref{fig-trail-climb-grid}} as lines on a coordinate grid.

    The ratio we computed in \hyperref[example-steep-trail]{Example~\ref{example-steep-trail}},
    \begin{equation*}\frac{\text{change in elevation}}{\text{change in horizontal position}}\end{equation*}  
    appears on the graphs in \hyperref[fig-trail-climb-grid]{Figure~\ref{fig-trail-climb-grid}} as
    \begin{equation*}\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}\end{equation*} 
    For example, as we travel along the line representing Stony Point trail, we move from the point\(0, 0)\) to the point \((2500, 400)\). The \(y\)-coordinate changes by \(400\) and the \(x\)-coordinate changes by \(2500\), giving the ratio \(0.16\) that we found in \hyperref[example-steep-trail]{Example~\ref{example-steep-trail}}2. We call this ratio the \terminology{slope} of the line.
%
\begin{definition}[]\label{definition-slope}
The \terminology{slope} of a line is the ratio

    The slope of a line is a number. It tells us how much the \(y\)-coordinates of points on the line increase when we increase their \(x\)-coordinates by 1 unit. For instance, the slope \(\frac{3}{4}\) in \hyperref[example-slope-grid]{Example~\ref{example-slope-grid}} means that the \(y\)-coordinate increases by \(\frac{3}{4}\) unit when the \(x\)-coordinate increases by 1 unit. For increasing graphs, a larger slope indicates a greater increase in altitude, and hence a steeper line.

\subsection[Notation for Slope]{Notation for Slope}\label{subsection-20}

    We use a shorthand notation for the ratio that defines slope,
    \begin{equation*}\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}\end{equation*} 
    The symbol \(\Delta\) (the Greek letter delta) is used in mathematics to denote \emph{change in}. In particular, \(\Delta y\) means \emph{change in \(y\)-coordinate}, and \(\Delta x\) means \emph{change in \(x\)-coordinate}. We also use the letter \(m\) to stand for slope. With these symbols, we can write the definition of slope as follows.

\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        As we move from the point \(P(−4, 2)\) to the point \(Q(5, −1)\), we move \(3\) units \emph{down}, so \(\Delta y = −3\). We then move \(9\) units to the right, so \(\Delta x = 9\).
        Thus, the slope is
        \begin{equation*}m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{-3}{9}=\frac{-1}{3}\end{equation*}\(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta x\) are labeled on the graph.

    We can move from point to point in either direction to compute the slope. The line graphed in \hyperref[example-negative-slope]{Example~\ref{example-negative-slope}} decreases as we move from left to right and hence has a negative slope. The slope is the same if we move from point \(Q\) to point \(P\) instead of from \(P\) to \(Q\). (See \hyperref[fig-negative-slope2]{Figure~\ref{fig-negative-slope2}}.) In that case, our computation looks like this:

    What does this value mean for the cost of renting a bicycle? The expression

    If we increase the length of the rental by 3 hours, the cost of the rental increases by 9 dollars. The slope gives the rate of increase in the rental fee, 3 dollars per hour. In general, we can make the following statement.

    We have defined the slope of a line to be the ratio \(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\) as we move from one point to another on the line. So far, we have computed \(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta x\) by counting squares on the graph, but this method is not always practical. All we really need are the coordinates of two points on the graph.
%
\par
We will use \terminology{subscripts} to distinguish the two points:%
\par
\(P_1\) means \emph{first point} and \(P_2\) means \emph{second point}.%
\par
We denote the coordinates of \(P_1\) by \((x_1, y_1)\) and the coordinates of \(P_2\) by \((x_2, y_2)\).

        Now consider a specific example. The line through the two points \(P_1 (2, 9)\) and \(P_2 (7,−6)\) is shown in \hyperref[fig-slope-formula]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-formula}}. We can find \(\Delta x\) by subtracting the \(x\)-coordinates of the points: 
        \begin{equation*}\Delta x = 7 − 2 = 5 \end{equation*}
        In general, we have 
        \begin{equation*}\Delta x = x_2 − x_1 \end{equation*}
        and similarly
        \begin{equation*}\Delta y = y_2 − y_1 \end{equation*}
    }%
}% end body 
{}% caption

\par

    These formulas work even if some of the coordinates are negative; in our example 
    \begin{equation*}\Delta y = y_2 − y_1 = −6 − 9 = −15\end{equation*}
    By counting squares \emph{down} from \(P_1\) to \(P_2\), we see that \(\Delta y\) is indeed \(−15\). The slope of the line in \hyperref[fig-slope-formula]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-formula}} is %

    The starting value, or the value of \(y\) at \(x = 0\), is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. Thus, we can write the equation of a line as
    \begin{equation*}f (x) = b + mx\end{equation*}
    where the constant term, \(b\), is the \(y\)-intercept of the line, and \(m\), the coefficient of \(x\), is the slope of the line. This form for the equation of a line is called the \terminology{slope-intercept form}.

    We can see that the \(y\)-intercept of each line is given by the constant term, \(b\). By examining the table of values, we can also see why the coefficient of \(x\)gives the slope of the line: 
    For \(f (x)\), each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) decreases by \(3\) units. For \(g(x)\), each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) increases by \(2\) units. For each graph, the coefficient of \(x\) is a scale factor that tells us how many units \(y\) changes for \(1\) unit increase in \(x\). But that is exactly what the slope tells us about a line.

    Look again at the lines in \hyperref[fig-slope-vs-intercept]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-vs-intercept}}: There is only one line that has a given slope and passes through a particular point. That is, the values of \(m\) and \(b\) determine the particular line. The value of \(b\) gives us a starting point, and the value of \(m\) tells us which direction to go to plot a second point. Thus, we can graph a line given in slope-intercept form without having to make a table of values.

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-164}{}We solve the equation for \(y\) in terms of \(x\).
            \begin{align*}
                −3y \&=6 − 4x\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                y \&= \frac{6 − 4x}{-3}

            \end{align*}
        \item\hypertarget{li-165}{}We see that the slope of the line is \(m = \frac{4}{3}\) and its \(y\)-intercept is \(b = −2\). We begin by plotting the \(y\)-intercept, \((0, −2)\). We then use the slope to find another point on the line. We have
        \begin{equation*}m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{4}{3}\end{equation*}
        so starting at \((0, −2)\), we move \(4\) units in the \(y\)-direction and \(3\) units in the \(x\)-direction, to arrive at the point \((3, 2)\). Finally, we draw the line through these two points. (See \hyperref[fig-slope-intercept]{\ref{fig-slope-intercept}}.)\end{enumerate}

The slope of a line is a ratio and can be written in many equivalent ways. In \hyperref[example-slope-intercept]{Example~\ref{example-slope-intercept}}, the slope is equal to \(\frac{8}{6}\), \(\frac{12}{9}\), and \(\frac{−4}{−3}\). We can use any of these fractions to locate a third
point on the line as a check. If we use \(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \frac{−4}{−3}\), we move down \(4\) units and left \(3\) units from the \(y\)-intercept to find the point \((−3, −6)\) on the line.%

        We can also use the slope-intercept form to find the equation of a line from its graph. First, note the value of the \(y\)-intercept from the graph, and then calculate the slope using two convenient points.

            The line crosses the \(y\)-axis at the point \((0, 3200)\), so the \(y\)-intercept is \(3200\). To calculate the slope of the line, locate another point, say \((20, 6000)\), and compute:

    We can find the equation for a line if we know its slope and \(y\)-intercept. What if we do not know the \(y\)-intercept, but instead know some other point on the line? There is only one line that passes through a given point and has a given slope. For example, we can graph the line of slope \(\frac{−3}{4}\) that passes through the point \((1, −4)\). }%
}% end body 
{}% caption 
\popValignCaptionBottom
\end{figure}
We first plot the given point, \((1, −4)\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-point-slope]{Figure~\ref{fig-point-slope}}. Then we use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is
        \begin{equation*}m =\frac{−3}{4}= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\end{equation*}
    so we move down \(3\) units and then \(4\) units to the right, starting from \((1, −4)\). This brings us to the point \((5, −7)\). We can then draw the line through these two points.%
\par
We can also find an equation for the line, as shown in Example 4.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-point-slope}
Find an equation for the line that passes through \((1, −4)\) and has slope \(\frac{−3}{4}\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We will use the formula for slope,
    \begin{equation*}m = \frac{y_2 − y_1}{x_2 − x_1}\end{equation*}
    We substitute \(\frac{−3}{4}\) for the slope, \(m\), and \((1, −4)\) for \((x_1, y_1)\). For the second point, \((x_2, y_2)\), we will use the variable point \((x, y)\). Substituting these values into the slope formula gives us
    \begin{equation*}\frac{−3}{4}= \frac{y − (−4)}{x − 1}=\frac{y + 4}{x − 1}\end{equation*}
    To solve for \(y\) we first multiply both sides by \(x − 1\).
    \begin{align*}
                \alert{(x-1)}\frac{−3}{4}\&
                =\frac{y +4}{x − 1}\alert{(x-1)} \&\&\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                \frac{−3}{4}(x-1)\&=y+4  \&\&\text{Apply the distributive law.}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                \frac{−3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}\&=y+4   \&\& 
                \text{Subtract 4 from both sides.}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                \frac{−3}{4}x-\frac{13}{4}\&=y \&\& \frac{3}{4}-4=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{16}{4}=\frac{-13}{4}
    \end{align*}
\end{example}
\par

    When we use the slope formula in this way to find the equation of a line, we substitute a variable point \((x, y)\) for the second point. This version of the formula, 
    \begin{equation*}m = \frac{y − y_1}{x − x_1}\end{equation*}
    is called the \terminology{point-slope form} for a linear equation. It is sometimes stated in another form obtained by clearing the fraction to get
    \begin{align*}
                \alert{(x−x_1)}m\&
                =\frac{y -y_1}{x − x_1}\alert{(x−x_1)} \&\&
                \text{Multiply both sides by }(x − x_1)\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                (x − x_1) m\&=y-y_1  \&\&\text{Clear fractions and solve for }y\text{.}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}

    We have spent most of this chapter analyzing models described by graphs or equations. To create a model, however, we often start with a quantity of data. Choosing an appropriate function for a model is a complicated process. In this section, we consider only linear models and explore methods for fitting a linear function to a collection of data points. First, we fit a line through two data points.

\subsection[Fitting a Line through Two Points]{Fitting a Line through Two Points}\label{subsection-28}

    If we already know that two variables are related by a linear function, we can find a formula from just two data points. For example, variables that increase or decrease at a constant rate can be described by linear functions.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-wine}
In 1993, Americans drank 188.6 million cases of wine. Wine consumption increased at a constant rate over the next decade, and we drank 258.3 million cases of wine in 2003. (Source: Los Angeles Times, Adams Beverage Group)%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-179}{}Find a formula for wine consumption, \(W\), in millions of cases, as a linear function of time, \(t\), in years since 1990.\item\hypertarget{li-180}{}State the slope as a rate of change. What does the slope tell us about this problem?\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-181}{}We have two data points of the form \((t, W)\), namely \((3, 188.6)\) and \((13, 258.3)\). We use the point-slope formula to fit a line through these two points. First, we compute the slope.
        \begin{equation*}\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}=\frac {258.3 − 188.6}{13 − 3}= 6.97\end{equation*}
        Next, we use the slope m = \(6.97\) and either of the two data points in the point-slope formula.
        \begin{align*}
            W \amp =W_1 + m(t − t_1) \\
            W \amp = 188.6 + 6.97(t − 3) \\
            W \amp = 167.69 + 6.97t
        \end{align*}

        Thus, \(W = f (t) = 167.69 + 6.97t\).
        \item\hypertarget{li-182}{}The slope gives us the rate of change of the function, and the units of the variables can help us interpret the slope in context.
        \begin{equation*}\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}= 
            \frac{258.3 − 188.6 \text{millions of cases}}{13 − 3\text{ years}}
                = 6.97 millions of cases /year
        \end{equation*}
        Over the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, wine consumption in the United States increased at a rate of 6.97 million cases per year.\end{enumerate}

Consider the three plots in \hyperref[fig-scatterplots]{Figure~\ref{fig-scatterplots}}. In \hyperref[fig-scatterplots]{Figure~\ref{fig-scatterplots}}a, the data points resemble a cloud of gnats; there is no apparent pattern to their locations. In \hyperref[fig-scatterplots]{Figure~\ref{fig-scatterplots}}b, the data follow a generally decreasing trend, but certainly do not all lie on the same line.

Thus, thinner people have lower BMI scores, and fatter people have higher scores. The Centers for Disease Control considers a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 to be healthy. The points on the scatterplot in \hyperref[fig-BMI]{Figure~\ref{fig-BMI}} show the BMI of Miss America from 1918 to 1998. From the data in the scatterplot, can we see a trend in Americans’ ideal of female beauty?

\begin{exercise}\label{hominid-brains}

    Human brains consume a large amount of energy, about 16 times as much as muscle tissue per unit weight. In fact, brain metabolism accounts for about 25\% of an adult human’s energy needs, as compared to about 5\% for other mammals. As hominid species evolved, their brains required larger and larger amounts of energy, as shown in \hyperref[fig-hominid-brains]{Figure~\ref{fig-hominid-brains}}.

    The process of predicting an output value based on a straight line that fits the data is called \terminology{linear regression}, and the line itself is called the \terminology{regression line}. The equation of the regression line is usually used (instead of a graph) to predict values.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-199}{}Find the equation of the regression line in \hyperref[example-BMI]{Example~\ref{example-BMI}}, \hyperref[fig-BMI]{Figure~\ref{fig-BMI}}.\item\hypertarget{li-200}{}Use the regression equation to predict the BMI of Miss America 1980.\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-201}{}We first calculate the slope by choosing two points on the regression line we drew in \hyperref[fig-BMI2]{Figure~\ref{fig-BMI2}}. The points we choose are not necessarily any of the original data points; instead they should be points on the regression line itself. The line appears to pass through the points \((17, 20)\) and \((67, 18)\). The slope of the line is then
        \begin{equation*}m = \frac{18 − 20}{67 − 17}\approx −0.04\end{equation*}
        Now we use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line. (If you need to review the point-slope formula, see \hyperref[linear-functions]{Section~\ref{linear-functions}}.) We substitute \(m = −0.04\) and use either of the two points for \((x_1, y_1)\); we will choose \((17, 20)\). The equation of the regression line is
        \begin{align*}
        y \amp = y_1 + m(x − x_1)\\
        y \amp = 20−0.04(x−17)
        \amp \amp \text{Simplify.}\\
        y \amp = 20.68 − 0.04t\\
        \end{align*}
        \item\hypertarget{li-202}{}We will use the regression equation to make our prediction. For Miss America 1980, \(t = 60\) and 
        \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(60) = 18.28\end{equation*}
        This value agrees well with the estimate we made in \hyperref[example-BMI]{Example~\ref{example-BMI}}.\end{enumerate}

\subsection[Linear Interpolation and Extrapolation]{Linear Interpolation and Extrapolation}\label{subsection-31}

        Using a regression line to estimate values between known data points is called \terminology{interpolation}. Making predictions beyond the range of known data is called \terminology{extrapolation}.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-BMI-extrapolation}
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-205}{}Use linear interpolation to estimate the BMI of Miss America 1960.\item\hypertarget{li-206}{}Use linear extrapolation to predict the BMI of Miss America 2001.\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-207}{}For 1960, we substitute \(t = 40\) into the regression equation we found in \hyperref[example-BMI-regression]{Example~\ref{example-BMI-regression}}. 
        \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(40) = 19.08\end{equation*} 
        We estimate that Miss America 1960 had a BMI of 19.08. (Her BMI was actually 18.79.)\item\hypertarget{li-208}{}For 2001, we substitute \(t = 81\) into the regression equation. 
        \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(81) = 17.44\end{equation*}\end{enumerate}
Our model predicts that Miss America 2001 had a BMI of 17.44. In fact, her BMI was 20.25. By the late 1990s, public concern over the self-image of young women had led to a reversal of the trend toward ever-thinner role models.%
\end{example}
\par

    \hyperref[example-BMI-extrapolation]{Example~\ref{example-BMI-extrapolation}}b illustrates an important fact about extrapolation: If we try to extrapolate too far, we may get unreasonable results. For example, if we use our model to predict the BMI of Miss America 2520 (when \(t = 600\)), we get 
    \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(600) =−3.32\end{equation*}
    Even if the Miss America pageant is still operating in 600 years, the winner cannot have a negative BMI. Our linear model provides a fair approximation for 1920–1990, but if we try to extrapolate too far beyond the known data, the model may no longer apply.

    We can also use interpolation and extrapolation to make estimates for nonlinear functions. Sometimes a variable relationship is not linear, but a portion of its graph can be approximated by a line. The graph in \hyperref[fig-Emily-height]{Figure~\ref{fig-Emily-height}} shows a child’s height each month. The graph is not linear because her rate of growth is not constant; her growth slows down as she approaches her adult height. However, over a short time interval the graph is close to a line, and that line can be used to approximate the coordinates of points on the curve.

    Estimating a line of best fit is a subjective process. Rather than base their estimates on such a line, statisticians often use the \terminology{least squares regression line}. This regression line minimizes the sum of the squares of all the vertical distances between the data points and the corresponding points on the line (see \hyperref[fig-least-squares]{Figure~\ref{fig-least-squares}}). Many calculators are programmed to find the least squares regression line, using an algorithm that depends only on the data, not on the appearance of the graph.

            A contagious disease whose spread is unchecked can devastate a confined population. For example, in the early sixteenth century Spanish troops introduced smallpox into the Aztec population in Central America, and the resulting epidemic contributed significantly to the fall of Montezuma’s empire. Suppose that an outbreak of cholera follows severe flooding in an isolated town of 5000 people. Initially (on Day 0), 40 people are infected. Every day after that, 25% of those still healthy fall ill.

    When studying nonlinear models, we will need to solve nonlinear equations. For example, in Investigation 3 we used a graph to solve the quadratic equation 
    \begin{equation*}18x − x^2 = 80\end{equation*} 
    Here is another example. \hyperref[fig-parabola]{Figure~\ref{fig-parabola}} shows a table and graph for the function \(y = 2x^2 − 5\).

\(y\)&\(13\)&\(3\)&\(-3\)&\(-5\)&\(-3\)&\(3\)&\(13\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

    You can see that there are two points on the graph for each \(y\)-value greater than \(−5\). For example, the two points with \(y\)-coordinate \(7\) are shown. To solve the equation 
    \begin{equation*}2x^2 − 5 = 7\end{equation*} 
    we need only find the x-coordinates of these points. From the graph, the solutions appear to be about 2.5 and −2.5.
%
\par

    How can we solve this equation algebraically? The opposite operation for squaring a number is taking a square root. So we can undo the operation of squaring by extracting square roots. We first solve for \(x^2\) to get
    \begin{align}
    2x^2 \amp= 12 \\
    x^2 \amp= 6\\
    \end{align}
    and then take square roots to find
    \begin{equation*}x = \pm\sqrt{6}\end{equation*}
%
\par

    Don't forget that every positive number has two square roots. The symbol \(\pm\) (read “plus or minus”) is a shorthand notation used to indicate both square roots of \(6\). The exact solutions are thus \(\sqrt{6}\) and \(-\sqrt{6}\). We can also find decimal approximations for the solutions using a calculator. Rounded to two decimal places, the approximate solutions are \(2.45\) and \(−2.45\).
%
\par

    In general, wecan solve equations of the form 
    \(ax^2 + c = 0\)
    by isolating \(x^2\) on one side of the equation and then taking the square root of each side. This method for solving equations is called \terminology{extraction of roots}.

    We can use extraction of roots to solve many formulas involving the square of the variable.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-volume-cone}
The formula \(V = \frac{1}{3} πr^2h\) gives the volume of a cone in terms of its height and radius. Solve the formula for \(r\) in terms of \(V\) and \(h\).
    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    Because the variable we want is squared, we use extraction of roots. First, multiply both sides by \(3\) to clear the fraction.
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{align*}
        3V \amp = 3(\frac{1}{3} πr^2h)\\
        3V \amp = πr^2h \amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by } πh.\\
        \frac{3V}{πh}\amp= r^2 \amp\amp \text{Take square roots.}\\
        \pm\sqrt{\frac{3V}{πh}}\amp= r
        \end{align*}
    \end{equation*}
    Because the radius of a cone must be a positive number, we use only the positive square root: 
    \(r = \sqrt{\frac{3V}{πh}}\).

    Equations of the form

    can also be solved by extraction of roots after isolating the squared expression, \((px + q)^2\).
%

    First, isolate the perfect square, \((x − 2)^2\).
    
        \begin{aligned}
        3(x − 2)^2 \amp = 48 \amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by }3.\\

        x − 2 \amp = \pm\sqrt{16} = \pm 4

\subsection[Compound Interest and Inflation]{Compound Interest and Inflation}\label{subsection-35}

    Many savings institutions offer accounts on which the interest is \emph{compounded annually}. At the end of each year, the interest earned is added to the principal, and the interest for the next year is computed on this larger sum of money.
%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  Compound Interest}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Compound Interest]{Compound Interest}\label{paragraphs-23}

    If interest is compounded annually for \(n\) years, the amount, \(A\), of money in an account is given by
    \begin{equation*}A = P(1 + r)^n\end{equation*}
    where \(P\) is the principal and \(r\) is the interest rate, expressed as a decimal fraction.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-compound-interest}

    Carmella invests \textdollar{}3000 in an account that pays an interest rate, \(r\), compounded annually.
    \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-249}{}Write an expression for the amount of money in Carmella’s account after two years.\item\hypertarget{li-250}{}What interest rate would be necessary for Carmella's account to grow to \textdollar{}3500 in two years?\end{enumerate}

%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-251}{}Use the formula above with \(P = 3000\) and \(n = 2\). Carmella’s account balance will be
            \begin{equation*}A = 3000(1 + r)^2\end{equation*}\item\hypertarget{li-252}{}Substitute \(3500\) for \(A\) in the equation.
        \begin{equation*}\alert{3500} = 3000(1 + r)^2\end{equation*}
        We can solve this equation in \(r\) by extraction of roots. First, isolate the perfect square.
        \begin{align}
        3500 \amp = 3000(1 + r )^2 \amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by 3000.} \\
        1.1\overline{6} \amp = (1 + r )^2 \amp\amp \text{Take the square root of both sides.} \\
        \pm 1.0801 \amp\approx 1 + r \amp\amp \text{Subtract 1 from both sides.}
        r \amp\approx 0.0801 \amp\amp \text{or }\amp r \approx −2.0801
        \end{align}
        Because the interest rate must be a positive number, we discard the negative solution. Carmella needs an account with interest rate \(r \approx 0.0801\), or just over 8\%, to achieve an account balance of \textdollar{}3500 in two years.\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\par

    The formula for compound interest also applies to the effects of inflation. For instance, if there is a steady inflation rate of 4\% per year, in two years an item that now costs \textdollar{}100 will cost
    \begin{align}
    A \amp= P(1 + r)^2\\
    \amp = 100(1 + 0.04)2 = \$108.16

    Because squaring and taking square roots are opposite operations, we can solve the equation
    \begin{equation*}\sqrt{x} = 8.2\end{equation*}
    by squaring both sides to get
    \begin{align}
    (\sqrt{x})^2 \amp= 8.2^2 \\
    x \amp = 67.24
    \end{align}
    Similarly, we can solve
    \begin{equation*}x^3 = 258\end{equation*}
    by taking the cube root of both sides, because cubing and taking cube roots are opposite operations. Rounding to three places, we find 
    \begin{align}
    \sqrt[3]{x^3}\amp=258\\
    x \amp \approx 6.366

    The notion of undoing operations can help us solve a variety of simple nonlinear equations. The operation of taking a reciprocal is its own opposite, so we solve the equation
    \begin{equation*}\frac{1}{x} = 50\end{equation*}
    by taking the reciprocal of both sides to get
    \begin{equation*}x = \frac{1}{50}= 0.02\end{equation*}

        Solve \(\frac{3}{x − 2}= 4\).

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We begin by taking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation to get
    \begin{equation*}\frac{x − 2}{3}= \frac{1}{4}\end{equation*}
    We continue to undo the operations in reverse order. Multiply both sides by \(3\).
    \begin{align}
    x − 2 \amp = \frac{3}{4} \amp\amp \text{Add 2 to both sides.}\\
    x \amp = 2 + \frac{3}{4}= \frac{11}{4} \amp\amp \frac{2}{1}=\frac{8}{4}
    \text{, so } \frac{2}{1}+ \frac{3}{4}=\frac{8}{4}+\frac{3}{4}=\frac{11}{4}

    The solution is \(\frac{11}{4}\), or \(2.75\).

    The point where the two graphs intersect locates the solution of the equation.

%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 2.2.1 Absolute Value}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Absolute Value]{Absolute Value}\label{subsection-37}

    The absolute value is used to discuss problems involving distance. For example, consider the number line in \hyperref[fig-abs-six]{Figure~\ref{fig-abs-six}}. Starting at the origin, we travel in opposite directions to reach the two numbers \(6\) and \(−6\), but the distance we travel in each case is the same.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth,]{images/fig-abs-six.pdf}\caption{\label{fig-abs-six}}
\end{figure}
\par

    The distance from a number \(c\) to the origin is called the \terminology{absolute value} of \(c\), denoted by \(\abs{c}\). Because distance is never negative, the absolute value of a number is always positive (or zero). Thus, \(\abs{6}= 6\) and \(\abs{−6} = 6\). In general, we define the absolute value of a number \(x\) as follows.
%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  Absolute Value}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Absolute Value]{Absolute Value}\label{paragraphs-24}

   The absolute value of x is defined by
   \begin{equation*}
    \abs{x} =
    \begin{cases}
    x \amp \text{if } x\ge 0\\
    -x  \amp \text{if } x\lt 0
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
%
\par

    This definition says that the absolute value of a positive number (or zero) is the same as the number. To find the absolute value of a negative number, we take the opposite of the number, which results in a positive number. For instance,
    \begin{equation*}\abs{−6} = −(−6) = 6\end{equation*}
    Absolute value bars act like grouping devices in the order of operations: You should complete any operations that appear inside absolute value bars before you compute the absolute value.

        The graphs of the eight basic functions considered in Investigation 4 are shown in \hyperref[fig-basic-a-c]{Figure~\ref{fig-basic-a-c}}, \hyperref[fig-basic-d-f]{Figure~\ref{fig-basic-d-f}}, and \hyperref[fig-basic-g-h]{Figure~\ref{fig-basic-g-h}}. Once you know the shape of each graph, you can sketch an accurate picture by plotting a few guidepoints and drawing the curve through those points. Usually, points (or vertical asymptotes!) at \(x = −1\), \(0\), and \(1\) make good guidepoints.

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Properties of the Basic Functions]{Properties of the Basic Functions}\label{subsection-40}

    In \hyperref[functions]{Section~\ref{functions}}, we saw that for most functions, \(f (a + b)\) is not equal to \(f (a) + f (b)\). We may be able to find some values of \(a\) and \(b\) for which \(f (a + b) = f (a) + f (b)\) is true, but not for all values of \(a\) and \(b\). If there is even one value of \(a\) or \(b\) for which \(f (a + b)\) is not equal to \(f (a) + f (b)\), we cannot claim that \(f (a + b) = f (a) + f (b)\) for that function. For example, for the function \(f (x) = x^2\), if we choose \(a = 3\) and \(b = 4\), then
    \begin{align*}
f (3 + 4) \amp = f (7) = 7^2 = 49\\
\text{but }~ f (3) + f (4) \amp = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
\end{align*}
    so we have proved that \(f (a + b) \ne f (a) + f (b)\) for the squaring function. (In fact, we already knew this because \((a + b)^2 \ne a^2 + b^2\) as long as neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is \(0\).)
%
\par

    What about multiplication? Which of the basic functions have the property that \(f (ab) = f (a) f (b)\) for all \(a\) and \(b\)? You will consider this question in the homework problems, but in particular you will need to recall the following  roperties of absolute
value.

\abs{a + b} \le \abs{a} + \abs{b} \amp\amp \text{Triangle inequality}\\
\abs{a  b} = \abs{a}  \abs{b} \amp\amp \text{Multiplicative property }
\end{align}%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-triangle-inequality}

        Verify the triangle inequality for three cases: \(a\) and \(b\) are both positive, \(a\) and \(b\) are both negative, and \(a\) and \(b\) have opposite signs.
    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We choose positive values for \(a\) and \(b\), say \(a = 3\) and \(b = 5\). Then 
    \begin{equation*}\abs{3 + 5} = \abs{8} = 8 ~\text{ and } ~ \abs{3}+\abs{5}= 3 + 5 = 8\end{equation*}
    so \(\abs{3 + 5} = \abs{3} + \abs{5}\). For the second case, we choose \(a = −3\) and \(b = −5\). Then
    \begin{equation*}\abs{−3 + (−5)} = \abs{−8} = 8 ~\text{ and } ~ \abs{−3}+\abs{−5} = 3 + 5 = 8\end{equation*}
    so \(\abs{−3 + (−5)} =\abs{−3}+\abs{−5}\). For the third case, we choose \(a = 3\) and \(b = −5\). Then
    \begin{equation*}\abs{3 + (−5)}=\abs{−2} = 2  ~\text{ and } ~ \abs{3}+\abs{−5}=3 + 5 = 8\end{equation*}
    so \(\abs{3 + (−5)} \lt \abs{3}+\abs{−5}\). In each case, \(\abs{a + b}\le\abs{a} +\abs{b}\).
\end{example}
\par

    Note that \emph{verifying} a statement for one or two values of the variables does not \emph{prove} the statement is true for \emph{all} values of the variables. However, working with examples can help us understand the meaning and significance of mathematical properties.

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Functions Defined Piecewise]{Functions Defined Piecewise}\label{subsection-41}

        A function may be defined by different formulas on different portions of the \(x\)-axis. Such a function is said to be defined \terminology{piecewise}. To graph a function defined piecewise, we consider each piece of the \(x\)-axis separately.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-piecewise}

        Graph the function defined by   
        \begin{equation*}
            f(x) =
            \begin{cases}
            x +1  \amp \text{if } x\le 1\\
            3  \amp \text{if } x\gt 1
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        Think of the plane as divided into two regions by the vertical line \(x = 1\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-piecewise]{Figure~\ref{fig-piecewise}}. In the left-hand region (\(x \le 1\)), we graph the line \(y = x + 1\). (The fastest way to graph the line is to plot its intercepts, \((−1, 0)\) and \((0, 1)\).)

We indicate this with a solid dot at the point \((1, 2)\). In the right-hand region (\(x \gt 1\)), we graph the horizontal line \(y = 3\). The value \(x = 1\) is not included in the second region, so the point \((1, 3)\) is not part of the graph. We indicate this with an open circle at the point \((1, 3)\).

    The absolute value function \(f (x) = \abs{x}\) is an example of a function that is defined piecewise.
    \begin{equation*}
        f (x) =\abs{x} =
        \begin{cases}
        x \amp \text{if } x\ge 0\\
        -x  \amp \text{if } x\lt 0
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    To sketch the absolute value function, we graph the line \(y = x\) in the first quadrant and the line \(y = −x\) in the second quadrant.

                \begin{cases}

            In the first region, \(x \ge 3\), we graph the line \(y = x − 3\). Because \(x = 3\) is included in this region, the endpoint of this portion of the graph, \((3, 0)\), is included, too. In the second region, \(x \lt 3\), we graph the line \(y = −x + 3\).

    Models for real situations are often variations of the basic functions introduced in \hyperref[basic-functions]{Section~\ref{basic-functions}}. In this section, we explore how certain changes in the formula for a function affect its graph. In particular, we will compare the graph of \(y = f (x)\) with the graphs of \(y = f (x) + k\), \(y = f (x + h)\), and \(y = a f (x)\) for different values of the constants \(k\), \(h\), and \(a\).

Compared with the graph of the basic function \(y = x^2\), the graph of \(f (x) = (x + 2)^2\) is shifted two units to the \emph{left}, as shown by the arrows. You can see why this happens by studying the function values in the table. Locate a particular \(y\)-value for \(y = x^2\), say, \(y = 1\). You must move two units to the left in the table to find the same \(y\)-value for \(f (x)\), as shown by the arrow. In fact, each \(y\)-value for \(f (x)\) occurs two units to the left when compared to the same \(y\)-value for \(y = x^2\).

If the Earth were not tilted on its axis, there would be 12 daylight hours every day all over the planet. But in fact, the length of a day in a particular location depends on the latitude and the time of year. The graph in Figure 2.26 shows \(H = f (t)\), the length of a day in Helsinki, Finland, \(t\) days after January 1, and \(R = g(t)\), the length of a day in Rome. Each is expressed as the number of hours greater or less than 12. Write a formula for \(f\) in terms of \(g\). What does this formula tell you?%

\subsection[The Shape of the Graph]{The Shape of the Graph}\label{subsection-45}

    Creating a good model for a situation often begins with deciding what kind of function to use. An appropriate model can depend on very qualitative considerations, such as the general shape of the graph. What sort of function has the right shape to describe the process we want to model? Should it be increasing or decreasing, or some combination of both? Is the slope constant or is it changing? In Examples 1 and 2, we investigate how the shape of a graph illustrates the nature of the process it models.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-home-to-school}

        Forrest leaves his house to go to school. For each of the following situations, sketch a possible graph of Forrest's distance from home as a function of time.
        \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-317}{}Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop.\item\hypertarget{li-318}{}Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop; then he waits there until the bus arrives.\item\hypertarget{li-319}{}Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop, waits there until the bus arrives, and then the bus drives him to school at a constant speed.\end{enumerate}

    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-320}{}The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in \hyperref[fig-home-to-school]{Figure~\ref{fig-home-to-school}}a. It begins at the origin because at the instant that Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when t = 0, y = 0.) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrest’s walking speed.
            \leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.150\textwidth,]{images/fig-home-to-school.pdf}\caption{\label{fig-home-to-school}}
\end{figure}
\item\hypertarget{li-321}{}The graph begins just as the graph in part (a) does. But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in \hyperref[fig-home-to-school]{Figure~\ref{fig-home-to-school}}b. The line has slope \(0\) because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is \(0\).
            \item\hypertarget{li-322}{}
                The graph begins just as the graph in part (b) does. The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in \hyperref[fig-home-to-school]{Figure~\ref{fig-home-to-school}}c.
            \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-walk-to-store}

    Erin walks from her home to a convenience store, where she buys some cat food, and then walks back home. Sketch a possible graph of her distance from home as a function of time.
\end{exercise}
\par

    The graphs in \hyperref[example-home-to-school]{Example~\ref{example-home-to-school}} are piecewise linear, because Forrest traveled at a constant rate in each segment. In addition to choosing a graph that is increasing, decreasing, or constant to model a process, we can consider graphs that bend upward or downward. The bend is called the \terminology{concavity} of the graph.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{concavity}
The two functions described in this example are both increasing functions, but they increase in different ways. Match each function to its graph in \hyperref[fig-concavity]{Figure~\ref{fig-concavity}} and to the appropriate table of values.%

    The speed of sound is a function of the temperature of the air in kelvins. (The temperature, \(T\), in kelvins is given by \(T = C + 273\), where \(C\) is the temperature in degrees Celsius.) The table shows the speed of sound, \(s\), in meters per second, at various temperatures, \(T\).

\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-330}{}
            The graph of the data is shown in \hyperref[fig-speed-sound]{Figure~\ref{fig-speed-sound}}. The shape of the graph reminds us of the square root function, \(y = \sqrt{x}\).
            \leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth,]{images/fig-speed-sound.pdf}\caption{\label{fig-speed-sound}}
\end{figure}
\item\hypertarget{li-331}{}
            We are looking for a value of \(k\) so that the function \(f (T ) = k \sqrt{T}\) fits the data. We substitute one of the data points into the formula and solve for \(k\). If we choose the point \((100, 200.6)\), we obtain 
            \begin{equation*}200.6 = k \sqrt{100 }\end{equation*}
            and solving for \(k\) yields \(k = 20.06\). We can check that the formula \(s = 20.06 \sqrt{T} \) is a good fit for the rest of the data points as well. Thus, we suggest the function 
            \begin{equation*}f (T ) = 20.06\sqrt{T}\end{equation*}
            as a model for the speed of sound.
        \item\hypertarget{li-332}{}First, use the model to calculate the speed of sound at a temperature of 20° Celsius. The Kelvin temperature is
            \begin{equation*}T = 20 + 273 = 293\end{equation*}
            so we evaluate \(s = f (T )\) for \(T = 293\).
            \begin{equation*}f (293) = 20.06\sqrt{293}\approx 343.4\end{equation*}
            Thus, \(s\) is approximately 343.4 meters per second.%
\par

                The lightning and the thunderclap occur simultaneously, and the speed of light is so fast (about 30,000,000 meters per second) that we see the lightning flash as it occurs. So if the sound of the thunderclap takes \(6\) seconds after the flash to reach us, we can use our calculated speed of sound to find our distance from the storm. 
                \begin{align}
                \text{distance} \amp= \text{speed} \times \text{time} \\
                \amp = (343.4\text{  m/sec}) (6 \text{ sec}) = 2060.4 \text{ meters}
                \end{align}
                The thunderstorm is \(2060\) meters, or about \(1.3\) miles, away.

\par

    At this point, a word of caution is in order. There is more to choosing a model than finding a curve that fits the data. A model based purely on the data is called an \terminology{empirical model}. However, many functions have similar shapes over small intervals of their input variables, and there may be several candidates that model the data. Such a model simply describes the general shape of the data set; the parameters of the model do not necessarily correspond to any actual process.
%
\par

    In contrast, \terminology{mechanistic models} provide insight into the biological, chemical, or physical process that is thought to govern the phenomenon under study. Parameters derived from mechanistic models are quantitative estimates of real system properties. Here is what GraphPad Software has to say about modeling:
%
\par

    "Choosing a model is a scientific decision. You should base your choice on your understanding of chemistry or physiology (or genetics, etc.). The choice should not be based solely on the shape of the graph.
%
\par

    "Some programs . . . automatically fit data to hundreds or thousands of equations and then present you with the equation(s) that fit the data best. Using such a program is appealing because it frees you from the need to choose an equation. The problem is that the program has no understanding of the scientific context of your experiment. The equations that fit the data best are unlikely to correspond to scientifically meaningful models. You will not be able to interpret the best-fit values of the variables, and the results are unlikely to be useful for data analysis.""

            An income of \(x = \alert{500}\) is in the first tax bracket, so the tax is 
            \begin{equation*}T(\alert{500}) = 0 + 0.10(\alert{500}) = 50\end{equation*} 
            The income \(x = 29,700\) is just on the upper edge of the second tax bracket. The amount over \textdollar{}7300 is \textdollar{}29,700 − \textdollar{}7300, so

            The income \(x = 40,000\) is in the third bracket, so the tax is

            The first two columns of the table give the tax brackets, or the \(x\)-intervals on which each piece of the function is defined. In each bracket, the tax \(T(x)\) is given by 
            \begin{equation*}\text{Base tax} + \text{Rate}\cdot(\text{Amount over bracket base}) \end{equation*}

    We can use number lines to solve equations such as
    \begin{equation*}\abs{3x − 6} = 9\end{equation*}
    First, factor out the coefficient of \(x\), to get \(\abs{3(x − 2)} = 9\). Because of the multiplicative property of the absolute value, namely that 
    \(\abs{ab} = \abs{a}\abs{b}\), we can write the left side as 
    \begin{align*}
    \abs{3}\abs{x − 2} \amp = 9 \\
    3\abs{x − 2} \amp= 9 \amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by 3.}\\
     \abs{x − 2} \amp = 3 
     \end{align*}
     which tells us that the distance between \(x\) and \(2\) is \(3\) units, so \(x = −1\) or \(x = 5\).

    To solve an absolute value equation algebraically, we use the definition of absolute value.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-abs-algebraic}

        Solve the equation \(\abs{3x − 6} = 9\) algebraically.
    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We write the piecewise definition of \(\abs{3x − 6}\).
    \begin{equation*}
    \abs{3x-6} =
    \begin{cases}
    3x-6 \amp \text{if } 3x-6\ge 0 \text{, or  } x\ge 2\\
    -(3x-6)  \amp \text{if } 3x − 6\lt 0  \text{, or  }x\lt 2
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    Thus, the absolute value equation \(\abs{3x − 6} = 9\) is equivalent to two regular equations:
    \begin{equation*}3x − 6 =9  \text{ or } −(3x − 6) = 9\end{equation*}
    or, by simplifying the second equation,
    \begin{equation*}3x − 6 =9 \text{ or } 3x − 6 = −9\end{equation*}
    Solving these two equations gives us the same solutions we found in \hyperref[example-abs-equation]{Example~\ref{example-abs-equation}}, \(x = 5\) and \(−1\).

\subsection[Absolute Value Inequalities]{Absolute Value Inequalities}\label{subsection-49}

    We can also use graphs to solve absolute value inequalities. Look again at the graph of \(y = \abs{3x − 6}\) in \hyperref[fig-abs-inequality]{Figure~\ref{fig-abs-inequality}}a. Because of the V-shape of the graph, all points with \(y\)-values less than \(9\) lie between the two solutions of \(\abs{3x − 6} = 9\), that is, between \(−1\) and \(5\). Thus, the solutions of the inequality \(\abs{3x − 6} \lt 9\) are \(−1 \lt x \lt 5\). (In the Homework problems, you will be asked to show this algebraically.) 
%
\par

    On the other hand, to solve the inequality \(\abs{3x − 6} \gt 9\), we look for points on the graph with \(y\)-values greater than \(9\). In \hyperref[fig-abs-inequality]{Figure~\ref{fig-abs-inequality}}b, we see that these points have \(x\)-values outside the interval between \(−1\) and \(5\). In other words, the solutions of the inequality \(\abs{3x − 6} \gt 9\) are \(x \lt −1\) or \(x \gt 5\).

%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad First, we solve the equation \(\abs{4x − 15} = 0.01\). There are two cases:
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
        4x − 15 \amp = 0.01 \amp \text{or} \amp\amp 4x − 15 \amp= −0.01 \\

        x \amp = 3.7525 \amp\amp\amp x \amp= 3.7475
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
        Because the inequality symbol is \(\lt\), the solutions of the inequality are between these two values: \(3.7475 \lt x \lt 3.7525\). In interval notation, the solutions are \((3.7475, 3.7525)\).

        Marlene is driving to a new outlet mall on Highway 17. There is a gas station at Marlene's on-ramp, where she buys gas and resets her odometer to zero before getting on the highway. The mall is only 15 miles from Marlene’s on-ramp, but she mistakenly drives past the mall and continues down the highway. Marlene's distance from the mall is a function of how far she has driven on Highway 17. See \hyperref[fig-Marlene-highway]{Figure~\ref{fig-Marlene-highway}}.

        Let \(x\) represent the number of miles on the highway and \(f (x)\) the number of miles from the mall. For \(x\)-values less than \(15\), the graph is a straight line with slope \(−1\) and \(y\)-intercept at \((0, 15)\), so its equation is \(y = −x + 15\). Thus,
        \begin{equation*}f (x) = −x + 15 \text{ when } 0 \le x \lt 15\end{equation*}
        On the other hand, when \(x \ge 15\), the graph of \(f\) is a straight line with slope \(1\) that passes through the point \((15, 0)\). The point-slope form of this line is
        \begin{equation*}y = 0 + 1(x − 15)\end{equation*}
        so \(y = x − 15\). Thus,
        \begin{equation*}f (x) = x − 15 \text{ when }  x \ge 15\end{equation*}
        Combining the two pieces, we obtain
        \begin{equation*}
        f (x) =

        \end{equation*}
        The graph of \(f (x)\) is a part of the graph of \(y = \abs{x − 15}\). If we think of the highway as a portion of the real number line, with Marlene’s on-ramp located at the origin, then the outlet mall is located at \(15\). Marlene's coordinate as she drives along the highway is \(x\), and the distance from Marlene to the mall is given by \(f (x) = \abs{x − 15}\).

\subsection[Measurement Error]{Measurement Error}\label{subsection-51}

    If you weigh a sample in chemistry lab, the scale’s digital readout might show \(6.0\) grams. But it is unlikely that the sample weighs \emph{exactly} \(6\) grams; there is always some error in measured values. Because the scale shows the weight as \(6.0\) grams, we know that the true weight of the sample must be between \(5.95\) grams and \(6.05\) grams: If the weight were less than \(5.95\) grams, the scale would round down to \(5.9\) grams, and if the weight were more than \(6.05\) grams, the scale would round up to \(6.1\) grams. We should report the mass of the sample as \(6 \pm 0.05\) grams, which tells the reader that the error in the measurement is no more than \(0.05\) grams. 
%
\par

    We can also describe this measurement error, or \terminology{error tolerance}, using an absolute value inequality. Because the measured mass m can be no more than \(0.05\) from \(6\), we write 
    \begin{equation*}\abs{m − 6} ≤ 0.05\end{equation*}

\item\hypertarget{li-383}{}From the table, we see that articles of any weight up to \(1\) ounce require \textdollar{}0.47 postage. This means that for all \(w\)-values greater than \(0\) but less than or equal to \(1\), the \(p\)-value is \(0.47\). Thus, the graph of \(p = g(w)\) between \(w = 0\) and \(w = 1\) looks like a small piece of the horizontal line \(p = 0.47\). Similarly, for all \(w\)-values greater than \(1\) but less than or equal to \(2\), the \(p\)-value is \(0.68\), so the graph on this interval looks like a small piece of the line \(p = 0.68\).

    The open circles at the left endpoint of each horizontal segment indicate that that point is not included in the graph; the closed circles are points on the graph. For instance, if \(w = 3\), the postage, \(p\), is \textdollar{}0.89, not \textdollar{}1.10. Consequently, the point \((3, 0.89)\) is part of the graph of \(g\), but the point \((3, 1.10)\) is not.
    \item\hypertarget{li-384}{}Postage rates are given for all weights greater than \(0\) ounces up to and including \(7\) ounces, so the domain of the function is the half-open interval \((0, 7]\). (The domain is an interval because there is a point on the graph for every \(w\)-value from \(0\) to \(7\).) The range of the function is not an interval, however, because the possible values for \(p\) do not include all the real numbers between \(0.3\) and \(1.75\). The range is the set of discrete values \(0.47\), \(0.68\), \(0.89\), \(1.10\), \(1.31\), \(1.52\), and \(1.73\).\end{enumerate}

    We must omit any \(x\)-values that do not make sense in the function's formula. Because division by zero is undefined, we cannot allow the denominator of \(\frac{1}{x−3}\) to be zero. Since \(x − 3 = 0\) when \(x = 3\), we exclude \(x = 3\) from the domain of \(g\). Thus, the domain of \(g\) is the set of all real numbers except \(3\).

            Use your graph and the function’s formula to find its range.\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

    For the functions we have studied so far, there are only two operations we must avoid when finding the domain: division by zero and taking the square root of a negative number. Many common functions have as their domain the entire set of real numbers. In particular, a linear function \(f (x) = b + mx\) can be evaluated at any real number value of \(x\), so its domain is the set of all real numbers. This set is represented in interval notation as \((−\infty, \infty)\).
%
\par

    The range of the linear function \(f (x) = b + mx\) (if \(m \ne 0\)) is also the set of all real numbers, because the graph continues infinitely at both ends. (See \hyperref[fig-two-graphs-of-lines]{Figure~\ref{fig-two-graphs-of-lines}}a.) If \(m = 0\), then \(f (x) = b\), and the graph of \(f\) is a horizontal line. In this case, the range consists of a single number, \(b\).

    In many applications, we may restrict the domain of a function to suit the situation at hand.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-falling-algebra-book}

    The function \(h = f (t) = 1454 − 16t^2\) gives the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of the Sears Tower as a function of time. Give a suitable domain for this application, and the corresponding range.

        \text{Xmin} \amp = −10 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 10\\

    Because \(t\) represents the time in seconds after the book was dropped, only positive \(t\)-values make sense for the problem. The book stops falling when it hits the ground, at \(h = 0\). You can verify that this happens at approximately \(t = 9.5\) seconds. Thus, only \(t\)-values between \(0\) and \(9.5\) are realistic for this application, so we restrict the domain of the function \(f\) to the interval \([0, 9.5]\). During that time period, the height, \(h\), of the book decreases from \(1454\) feet to \(0\) feet. The range of the function on the domain \([0, 9.5]\) is \([0, 1454]\). The graph is shown in \hyperref[fig-falling-algebra-book]{Figure~\ref{fig-falling-algebra-book}}.

    We next turn our attention to a large and useful family of functions called \terminology{power functions}. This family includes transformations of several of the basic functions, such as
    \begin{equation*}
        F(d) = \frac{k}{d^2} ~\text{ and } ~ S(T ) = 20.06\sqrt{T}
    \end{equation*}
    The first function gives the gravitational force, \(F\), exerted by the sun on an object at a distance, \(d\). The second function gives the speed of sound, \(S\), in terms of the air temperature, \(T\). By extending our definition of exponent to include negative numbers and fractions, we will be able to express such functions in the form \(f (x) = kx^n\). Here is an example of a power function with a fractional exponent.

    In 1932, Max Kleiber published a remarkable equation for the metabolic rate of an animal as a function of its mass. The table on page 234 shows the mass of various animals in kilograms and their metabolic rates, in kilocalories per day. A plot of the data, resulting in the famous “mouse-to-elephant” curve, is shown in the figure.

	The ratio \(\frac{\text{total price}}{\text{number of gallons}}\), or price per gallon, is the same for each pair of values in \hyperref[table-gasoline]{Table~\ref{table-gasoline}}. This agrees with everyday experience: The price per gallon of gasoline is the same no matter how many gallons you buy. Thus, the total price of a gasoline purchase is directly proportional to the number of gallons purchased.

\par

	The second table, \hyperref[table-population]{Table~\ref{table-population}}, shows the population of a small town as a function of the town’s age. The ratio number of people number of years gives the average rate of growth of the population in people per year. You can see that this ratio is not constant; in fact, it increases as time goes on. Thus, the population of the town is not proportional to its age.

	The graphs of these two functions are shown in \hyperref[fig-gasoline-and-population-graphs]{Figure~\ref{fig-gasoline-and-population-graphs}}. We see that the price, \(P\), of a fill-up is a linear function of the number of gallons, \(g\), purchased. This should not be surprising if we write an equation relating the variables \(g\) and \(P\). Because the ratio of their values is constant, we can write
	\begin{equation*}\frac{P}{g}= k\end{equation*}
	where \(k\) is a constant. In this example, the constant \(k\) is \(2.40\), the price of gasoline per gallon. Solving for \(P\) in terms of \(g\), we have
	\begin{equation*}P = kg = 2.40g\end{equation*}

	Direct variation defines a linear function of the form
	\begin{equation*}y = f (x) = kx\end{equation*}
	The positive constant \(k\) in the equation \(y = kx\) is just the slope of the graph, so it tells us how rapidly the graph increases. Compared to the standard form for a linear function, \(y = b + mx\), the constant term, \(b\), is zero, so the graph of a direct variation passes through the origin.

\subsection[The Scaling Property of Direct Variation]{The Scaling Property of Direct Variation}\label{subsection-57}

	The fact that the constant term is zero in a direct variation is significant: If we double the value of \(x\), then the value of \(y\) will double also. In fact, increasing \(x\) by any factor causes \(y\) to increase by the same factor. For example, in \hyperref[table-gasoline]{Table~\ref{table-gasoline}} doubling the number of gallons of gas purchased, say, from \(4\) gallons to \(8\) gallons or from \(6\) gallons to \(12\) gallons, causes the total price to double also. Or, consider investing \(\$800\) for one year at \(7\)\% simple interest, as in \hyperref[example-circumference-and-simple-interest]{Example~\ref{example-circumference-and-simple-interest}}b. The interest earned is
	\begin{equation*}I = 0.07(800) = \$56\end{equation*}
	If we increase the investment by a factor of \(1.6\) to \(1.6 (800)\), or \(\$1280\), the interest will be 
	\begin{equation*}I = 0.07(1280) = \$89.60\end{equation*}
	You can check that multiplying the original interest of \(\$56\) by a factor of \(1.6\) does give the same figure for the new interest, \(\$89.60\).

	If we know any one pair of values for the variables in a direct variation, we can find the constant of variation. We can then use the constant to write a formula for one of the variables as a function of the other.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-falling-into-grand-canyon}

	If an object is dropped from a great height, say, off the rim of the Grand Canyon, its speed, \(v\), varies directly with the time, \(t\), the object has been falling.

	In any example of direct variation, as the input variable increases through positive values, the output variable increases also.

	Recall that if \(y\) varies directly with \(x\), then doubling \(x\) causes \(y\) to double also. But is the area of a \(16\)-inch circular pizza double the area of an \(8\)-inch pizza? If you double the dimensions of a model of a skyscraper, will its weight double also? You probably know that the answer to both of these questions is \emph{No}. The area of a circle is proportional to the \emph{square} of its radius, and the volume (and hence the weight) of an object is proportional to the \emph{cube} of its linear dimension. Variation with a power of \(x\) produces a different scaling effect.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-scaling-weight}

	The Taipei 101 building is 1671 feet tall, and in 2006 it was the tallest skyscraper in the world. Show that doubling the dimensions of a model of the Taipei 101 building produces a model that weighs \(8\) times as much.
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
	The Taipei 101 skyscraper is approximately box shaped, so its volume is given by the product of its linear dimensions, \(V = lwh\). The weight of an object is proportional to its volume, so the weight, \(W\), of the model is
	\begin{equation*}W = klwh\end{equation*}
	where the constant \(k\) depends on the material of the model. If we double the length, width, and height of the model, then
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		W_\text{new} \amp = k(2l)(2w)(2h)\\
		\amp = 2^3(klwh) = 8W_\text{old}
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
	The weight of the new model is \(2^3 = 8\) times the weight of the original model.
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-double-pizza-diameter}

	Use the formula for the area of a circle to show that doubling the diameter of a pizza quadruples its area.
\end{exercise}
\par

	In general, if \(y\) varies directly with a power of \(x\), that is, if \(y = kx^n\), then doubling the value of \(x\) causes \(y\) to increase by a factor of \(2^n\). In fact, if we multiply \(x\) by any positive number \(c\), then
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		y_\text{new} \amp =k(cx)^n
		\amp =c^n(kx^n) = c^n(y_\text{old})
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
	so the value of \(y\) is multiplied by \(c^n\). We will call \(n\) the \terminology{scaling exponent}, and you will often see variation described in terms of scaling. For example, we might say that "the area of a circle scales as the square of its radius."" (In many applications, the power \(n\) is called the \emph{scale factor}, even though it is not a factor but an exponent.)

	How long does it take to travel a distance of \(600\) miles? The answer depends on your average speed. If you are on a bicycle trip, your average speed might be \(15\) miles per hour. In that case, your traveling time will be
	\begin{equation*}T = \frac{D}{R}= \frac{600}{15}= 40 \text{ hours}\end{equation*}
	(Of course, you will have to add time for rest stops; the \(40\) hours are just your travel time.) 
%
\par

	If you are driving your car, you might average \(50\) miles per hour. Your travel time is then
	\begin{equation*}T = \frac{D}{R}= \frac{600}{50}= 12 \text{ hours}\end{equation*}
%
\par

	If you take a commercial air flight, the plane’s speed might be \(400\) miles per hour, and the flight time would be
	\begin{equation*}T = \frac{D}{R}= \frac{600}{400}= 1.5 \text{ hours}\end{equation*}
%
\par

	You can see that for higher average speeds, the travel time is shorter. In other words, the time needed for a \(600\)-mile journey is a decreasing function of average speed. In fact, a formula for the function is
	\begin{equation*}T = f (R) = \frac{600}{R}\end{equation*}

	Inverse variation describes a decreasing function, but not every decreasing function represents inverse variation. People sometimes mistakenly use the phrase \emph{varies inversely} to describe any decreasing function, but if \(y\) varies inversely with \(x\), the variables must satisfy an equation of the form \(y = \frac{k}{x}\), or \(xy = k\).

		If you double your distance from the center of the Earth, what happens to your weight? What if you triple the distance?
	%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
	Suppose you weigh \(W\) pounds at distance \(D\) from the center of the Earth. Then 	\(W = \frac{k}{D^2}\). At distance \(2D\), your weight will be
	\begin{equation*}w = \frac{k}{(2D)^2}= \frac{k}{4D^2}= \frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{k}{D^2}
		= \frac{1}{4}W\end{equation*}
	Your new weight will be \(\frac{1}{4}\) of your old weight. By a similar calculation, you can check that by tripling the distance, your weight will be reduced to \(\frac{1}{9}\) of its original value.

\subsection[Finding a Formula for Inverse Variation]{Finding a Formula for Inverse Variation}\label{subsection-62}

	If we know that two variables vary inversely and we can find one pair of corresponding values for the variables, we can determine \(k\), the constant of variation.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-EMR-vs-distance}

	The intensity of electromagnetic radiation, such as light or radio waves, varies inversely with the square of the distance from its source. Radio station KPCC broadcasts a signal that is measured at \(0.016\) watt per square meter by a receiver \(1\) kilometer away.
	\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-410}{}Write a formula that gives signal strength as a function of distance.\item\hypertarget{li-411}{}If you live \(5\) kilometers from the station, what is the strength of the signal you will receive?\end{enumerate}

%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-412}{}
		Let \(I\) stand for the intensity of the signal in watts per square meter, and \(d\) for the distance from the station in kilometers. Then \(I = \frac{k}{d^2}\). To find the constant \(k\), we substitute \(0.016\) for \(I\) and \(1\) for \(d\). Solving for \(k\) gives us
		\begin{align*}
			0.016 \amp = \frac{k}{1^2} \\
			k \amp = 0.016 (1^2) = 0.016
		\end{align*}
		Thus, \(I = \frac{0.016}{d^2}\).
	\item\hypertarget{li-413}{}
		Now we can substitute \(5\) for \(d\) and solve for \(I\).
		\begin{equation*}I = \frac{0.016}{5^2}= 0.00064\end{equation*}
		At a distance of \(5\) kilometers from the station, the signal strength is \(0.00064\) watt per square meter.

    As we continue to divide by \(2\), we generate fractions whose denominators are powers of 2. In particular,
    \begin{equation*}2^{−1} = \frac{1}{2}= \frac{1}{2^1} ~ \text{ and } ~ 2^{−2} = \frac{1}{4}= \frac{1}{2^2}\end{equation*}

%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-BMI-index}

    The body mass index, or BMI, is one measure of a person’s physical fitness. Your body mass index is defined by
    \begin{equation*}BMI = wh^{−2}\end{equation*}
    where \(w\) is your weight in kilograms and \(h\) is your height in meters. The World Health Organization classifies a person as obese if his or her BMI is \(25\) or higher.

That is, for a fixed weight, BMI decreases as height increases.\item\hypertarget{li-427}{}To find the height that gives a BMI of \(25\), we solve the equation \(25 = 319h^{−2}\). Note that the variable \(h\) appears in the denominator of a fraction, so we begin by clearing the denominator—in this case we multiply both sides of the equation by \(h^2\).
    \begin{align*}
    25 \amp = \frac{319}{h^2} \amp\amp \text{Multiply both sides by }h^2.\\
    25h^2 \amp = 319 \amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by }25.\\
    h^2 \amp = 12.76 \amp\amp \text{Extract square roots.}\\ 
    h \amp\approx 3.57

    To have a BMI under \(25\), Yarbrough would have to be over \(3.57\) meters, or \(11\) feet \(8\) inches tall. (In fact, he is \(6\) feet \(8\) inches tall.)\end{enumerate}

        A function of the form

    Most applications are concerned with positive variables only, so many models use only the portion of the graph in the first quadrant.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-trebuchet}

    In the Middle Ages in Europe, castles were built as defensive strongholds. An attacking force would build a huge catapult called a trebuchet to hurl rocks and scrap metal inside the castle walls. The engineers could adjust its range by varying the mass of the projectiles. The mass, \(m\), of the projectile should be inversely proportional to the square of the distance, \(d\), to the target.

Find the constant of proportionality; then rewrite your formula for \(m\).\item\hypertarget{li-439}{}Graph \(m = f (d)\).\item\hypertarget{li-440}{}The trebuchet is \(180\) meters from the courtyard within the castle. What size projectile will hit the target?\item\hypertarget{li-441}{}The attacking force would like to hurl a \(100\)-kilogram projectile at the castle. How close must the attackers bring their trebuchet?\end{enumerate}

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-442}{}If we use \(k\) for the constant of proportionality, then \(m = \frac{k}{d^2}\). Rewriting this equation with a negative exponent gives \(m = kd^{−2}\).\item\hypertarget{li-443}{}Substitute \(m = 20\) and \(d = 250\) to obtain

    They must locate the trebuchet \(\sqrt{12,500}\approx 111.8\) meters from the castle.

    The function \(m = \frac{k}{d^2}\) is an example of an \terminology{inverse square law}, because \(m\) varies inversely with the square of \(d\). Such laws are fairly common in physics and its applications, because gravitational and other forces behave in this way. Here is a more modern example of an inverse square law.
%
\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-cellphone-coverage}

    Cell phone towers typically transmit signals at \(10\) watts of power. The signal strength varies inversely with the square of distance from the tower, and \(1\) kilometer away the signal strength is \(0.8\) picowatt. (A picowatt is \(10^{−12}\) watt.) Cell phones can receive a signal as small as \(0.01\) picowatt. How far can you be from the nearest tower and still hope to have cell phone reception?

    Recall that \(s\) is a square root of \(b\) if \(s^2 = b\), and \(s\) is a cube root of \(b\) if \(s^3 = b\). In a similar way, we can define the fourth, fifth, or sixth root of a number.

\subsection[Exponential Notation for Radicals]{Exponential Notation for Radicals}\label{subsection-68}

    A convenient notation for radicals uses fractional exponents. Consider the expression \(9^{1/2}\). What meaning can we attach to an exponent that is a fraction? The third law of exponents says that when we raise a power to a power, we multiply the exponents together:
    \begin{equation*}\left(x^a\right)^b = x^{ab}\end{equation*}
    Therefore, if we square the number \(9^{1/2}\), we get
    \begin{equation*}\left(9^{1/2}\right)^2 = 9^{(1/2)(2)} = 9^1 = 9\end{equation*}
    Thus, \(9^{1/2}\) is a number whose square is \(9\). But this means that \(9^{1/2}\) is a square root of \(9\), or
    \begin{equation*}9^{1/2} =\sqrt{9} = 3\end{equation*}
    In general, any nonnegative number raised to the \(1/2\) power is equal to the positive square root of the number, or
    \begin{equation*}a^{1/2} =\sqrt{a}\end{equation*}

\subsection[Using Fractional Exponents to Solve Equations]{Using Fractional Exponents to Solve Equations}\label{subsection-71}

    In Chapter 2, we learned that raising to powers and taking roots are inverse operations, that is, each operation undoes the effects of the other. This relationship is especially easy to see when the root is denoted by a fractional exponent. For example, to solve the equation 
    \begin{equation*}x^4 = 250\end{equation*}
    we would take the fourth root of each side. But instead of using radical notation, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power \(\frac{1}{4}\):
    \begin{align*}
    \left(x^4\right)^{1/4} \amp= 250^{1/4} \\
    x \amp \approx 3.98
    \end{align*}
    The third law of exponents tells us that \(\left(x^a\right)^b = x^{ab}\), so \(\left(x^4\right)^{1/4} = x^{(1/4)(4)} = x^1\). In general, to solve an equation involving a power function \(x^n\), we first isolate the power, then raise both sides to the exponent \(\frac{1}{n}\).
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-star-luminosity}

        For astronomers, the mass of a star is its most important property, but it is also the most difficult to measure directly. For many stars, their luminosity, or brightness, varies roughly as the fourth power of the mass.

    We cannot take an even root of a negative number. (See \hyperref[Roots-of-Negative-Numbers]{Subsection~\ref{Roots-of-Negative-Numbers}} "A Note on Roots of Negative Numbers" at the end of this section.) Hence, if \(n\) is even, the domain of \(f (x) = x^{1/n}\) is restricted to nonnegative real numbers, but if \(n\) is odd, the domain of \(f (x) = x^{1/n}\) is the set of all real numbers.

    We will also encounter power functions with negative exponents. For example, an animal's heart rate is related to its size or mass, with smaller animals generally having faster heart rates. The heart rates of mammals are given approximately by the power function

    A \terminology{radical equation} is one in which the variable appears under a square root or other radical. The radical may be denoted by a fractional exponent. For example, the equation
    \begin{equation*}5x^{1/3} = 32\end{equation*}
    is a radical equation because \(x^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{x}\). To solve the equation, we first isolate the power to get

    Then we raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal of \(\frac{1}{3}\), or 3.

    The car was traveling at approximately \(44\) miles per hour.\item\hypertarget{li-509}{}We would like to find the value of \(d\) when the value of \(v\) is known. We substitute \(v = 80\) into the formula and solve the equation

    Because \(d\) appears to the power \(\frac{1}{2}\), we first square both sides of the equation to get
    \begin{align*}
    80^2 \amp = \left((24d)^{1/2}\right)^2 \amp\amp\text{Square both sides.}\\
    6400 \amp = 24d \amp\amp\text{Divide by }24.\\
    266.\overline{6} \amp = d

    You can check that this value for \(d\) works in the original equation. Thus, the car will skid approximately \(267\) feet.

    Thus, we can solve an equation where one side is an nth root of x by raising both sides of the equation to the nth power.

Similarly, \(\sqrt[4]{−16}\) is not a real number, because there is no real number \(r\) for which \(r^4 = −16\). (Both of these radicals are \terminology{complex numbers}. Complex numbers are discussed in Chapter 7.) In general, we cannot find an even root (square root, fourth root, and so on) of a negative number.
%
\par

    On the other hand, every positive number has two even roots that are real numbers. For example, both \(3\) and \(−3\) are square roots of \(9\). The symbol \(\sqrt{9}\) refers only to the positive, or principal root, of \(9\). If we want to refer to the negative square root of \(9\), we must write \(−\sqrt{9} = −3\). Similarly, both \(2\) and \(−2\) are fourth roots of \(16\), because \(2^4 = 16\) and \((−2)^4 = 16\). However, the symbol \(\sqrt[4]{16}\) refers to the principal, or positive, fourth root only. Thus,
    \begin{equation*}\sqrt[4]{16} = 2 ~~ \text{ and } ~~ −\sqrt[4]{16} = −2\end{equation*}
%
\par

    Things are simpler for odd roots (cube roots, fifth roots, and so on). Every real number, whether positive, negative, or zero, has exactly one real-valued odd root. For example,
    \begin{equation*}\sqrt[5]{32} = 2 ~~ \text{ and } ~~ \sqrt[5]{−32} = −2\end{equation*}
%
\par

    Here is a summary of our discussion.

\subsection[Powers of the Form \(a^{m/n}\)]{Powers of the Form \(a^{m/n}\)}\label{subsection-75}

    In the last section, we considered powers of the form \(a^{1/n}\), such as \(x^{1/3}\) and \(x^{−1/4}\), and saw that \(a^{1/n}\) is equivalent to the root \(\sqrt[n]{a}\). What about other fractional exponents? What meaning can we attach to a power of the form \(a^{m /n}\)?
%
\par

    Consider the power \(x^{3/2}\). Notice that the exponent \(\frac{3}{2}= 3(\frac{1}{2})\), and thus by the third law of exponents, we can write
    \begin{equation*}(x^{1/2})3 = x^{(1/2)^3} = x^{3/2}\end{equation*}
    In other words, we can compute \(x^{3/2}\) by first taking the square root of \(x\) and then cubing the result. For example,
    \begin{align*}
        100^{3/2} \amp = (\alert{100^{1/2}})3 \amp\amp \text{Take the square root of 100.}\\
        \amp= \alert{10^3} = 1000  \amp\amp \text{Cube the result.}
    \end{align*}
    We will define fractional powers only when the base is a positive number.

    Perhaps the single most useful piece of information a scientist can have about an animal is its metabolic rate. The metabolic rate is the amount of energy the animal uses per unit of time for its usual activities, including locomotion, thermoregulation, growth, and reproduction. The basal metabolic rate, or BMR, sometimes called the resting metabolic rate, is the minimum amount of energy the animal can expend in order to survive.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-Kleiber-rule}

    A revised form of Kleiber's rule states that the basal metabolic rate for many groups of animals is given by 
    \begin{equation*}B(m) = 70m^{0.75}\end{equation*}

\subsection[More about Scaling]{More about Scaling}\label{subsection-77}

    In \hyperref[example-Kleiber-rule]{Example~\ref{example-Kleiber-rule}} we saw that large animals eat less than smaller ones, relative to their body weight. This is because the scaling exponent in Kleiber's rule is less than \(1\). For example, let \(s\) represent the mass of a squirrel. The mass of a moose is then \(600s\), and its metabolic rate is
    \begin{align*}
    B(600s) \amp = 70(600s)^{0.75} \\
    \amp = 600^{0.75} \cdot 70s^{0.75} = 121B(s)
    \end{align*}
    or \(121\) times the metabolic rate of the squirrel. Metabolic rate scales as \(k^{0.75}\), compared to the mass of the animal.

    In a famous experiment in the 1960s, an elephant was given LSD. The dose was determined from a previous experiment in which a \(2.6\)-kg cat was given \(0.26\) gram of LSD. Because the elephant weighed \(2970\) kg, the experimenters used a direct proportion to calculate the dose for the elephant:
    \begin{equation*}\frac{0.26 \text{ g}}{2.6 \text{ kg}}= \frac{x \text{ g}}{2970 \text{ kg}}\end{equation*}
    and arrived at the figure \(297\) g of LSD. Unfortunately, the elephant did not survive the experiment.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-Kleiber-elephant-LSD-dose}

    Use Kleiber's rule and the dosage for a cat to estimate the corresponding dose for an elephant.
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    If the experimenters had taken into account the scaling exponent of \(0.75\) in metabolic rate, they would have used a smaller dose. Because the elephant weighs \(\frac{2970}{2.6}\) , or about \(1142\) times as much as the cat, the dose would be \(1142^{0.75} = 196\) times the dosage for a cat, or about \(51\) grams.

    According to the third law of exponents, when we raise a power to another power, we multiply the exponents together. In particular, if the two exponents are reciprocals, then their product is \(1\). For example,
    \begin{equation*}\left(x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2} = x^{(2/3) (3/2)} = x^1 = x\end{equation*}
    This observation can help us to solve equations involving fractional exponents. For instance, to solve the equation
    \begin{equation*}x^{2/3} = 4\end{equation*}
    we raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal power, \(3/2\). This gives us
    \begin{align*}
    \left(x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2} \amp = 4^{3/2} \\
    x \amp = 8

\subsection[Functions of Two or More Variables]{Functions of Two or More Variables}\label{subsection-81}

    So far, we have studied functions that relate values of an output variable to values of a single input variable. But it is not uncommon for an output variable to depend on two or more inputs. Many familiar formulas describe functions of several variables. For example, the perimeter of a rectangle depends on its length and width. The volume of a cylinder depends on its radius and height. The distance you travel depends on your speed and the time you spent traveling. Each of these formulas can be written with function notation.
    \begin{align*}
    \amp P = f (l,w) = 2l + 2w \amp\amp \text{Perimeter is a function of length and width.}\\
    \amp V = f (r, h) = πr 2h \amp\amp \text{Volume is a function of radius and height.}\\
    \amp d = f (r, t) = rt \amp\amp \text{Distance is a function of rate and time.}
    \end{align*}

\begin{example}[]\label{example-rental-car}

    The cost, \(C\), of driving a rental car is given by the function
    \begin{equation*}C = f (t, g) = 29.95t + 2.80g\end{equation*}
    where \(t\) is the number of days you rent the car and \(g\) is the number of gallons of gas you buy.

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-562}{}We substitute \(3\) for \(t\) and \(10\) for \(g\) to find
        \begin{equation*}f (3, 10) = 29.95(3) + 2.80(10) = 117.85\end{equation*}
        It will cost \textdollar{}\(117.85\) to rent a car for \(3\) days and buy \(10\) gallons of gas.\item\hypertarget{li-563}{}We would like to find the value of \(g\) when \(t = 2\) and \(C = 100\). That is, we want to solve the equation
        \begin{align*}
        100 \amp = f (2, g) = 29.95(2) + 2.80g \\
        100 \amp = 59.90 + 2.80g \\
        g \amp = 14.32
        \end{align*}
        You can buy \(14.32\) gallons of gas.

\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-water-stream}

    The maximum height that the water stream from a fire hose can reach depends on the water pressure and the diameter of the nozzle, and is given by the function
    \begin{equation*}H = f (P, n) = 26 + \frac{5}{8}P + 5n\end{equation*}
    where \(P\) is the nozzle pressure in psi, and \(n\) is measured in \(18\)-inch increments over the standard nozzle diameter of \(\frac{3}{4}\) inch.

    Sometimes we can find patterns relating the entries in a table.

\begin{example}[]\label{example-load}

    Rectangular beams of a given length can support a load, \(L\), that depends on both the width and the depth of the beam, so that \(L = f (w, d)\). The table shows some of the values.

How does the load depend on the depth?\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-578}{}In the row for \(2\) cm and the column for \(5\) cm, we find that \(f (2, 5) = 500\). A beam of width \(2\) cm and depth \(5\) cm can support a maximum load of \(500\) kilograms.\item\hypertarget{li-579}{}In the row for \(5\) cm and the column for \(2\) cm, we find that \(f (5, 2) = 200\), so \(f (2, 5) \ne f (5, 2)\).\item\hypertarget{li-580}{}Using the row for width \(3\) cm, we make a new table showing the relationship between load and depth. The increase in load for each increase of \(1\) cm in depth is not a constant, so the graph in \hyperref[fig-load-vs-depth]{Figure~\ref{fig-load-vs-depth}} is not a straight line. The curve does pass through the origin, so perhaps the data describe direct variation with a power of depth. If we try the equation \(L = kd^2\) and use the point \((1, 30)\), we find that \(30 = k · 1^2\), so \(k = 30\). You can check that the equation \(L = 30d^2\) does fit the rest of the data points.\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-581}{}For the table in \hyperref[example-load]{Example~\ref{example-load}}, consider the column corresponding to a beam depth of \(3\) cm. Graph \(L\) as a function of \(w\) when the depth is constant at \(d = 3\).\item\hypertarget{li-582}{}Find a formula for \(L\) as a function of \(w\) for \(d = 3\).\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\par

    In \hyperref[exercise-load]{Exercise~\ref{exercise-load}}, you should find that the load varies directly with width when the depth is \(3\) centimeters. In fact, the load varies directly with width for any fixed depth. In \hyperref[example-load]{Example~\ref{example-load}}, we saw that the load varies with the square of depth when the width is \(3\) centimeters, and this relationship also holds for any value of \(w\). Consequently, we can find a constant \(k\) such that 
    \begin{equation*}\text{load} = k \cdot \text{width} \cdot \text{depth}^2\end{equation*}
    This relationship between variables is an example of \terminology{joint variation}.
%
\begin{definition}[Joint Variation]\label{definition-6}
%
\par

    If\begin{equation*}z = kxy \text{, } ~~ k \gt 0\end{equation*}
    we say that \(z\) \terminology{varies jointly} with \(x\) and \(y\). If
    \begin{equation*}z = k\frac{x}{y}\text{, } ~~ k \gt 0\text{, } ~~ y  \ne 0\end{equation*}
    we say that \(z\) varies directly with \(x\) and inversely with \(y\).
%
\end{definition}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-load2}

    Find a formula for load as a function of width and depth for the data in \hyperref[example-load]{Example~\ref{example-load}}.
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    The function we want has the form
    \begin{equation*}L = f (w, d) = kwd^2\end{equation*}
    for some value of \(k\). We use the fact that \(L = 10\) when \(w = 1\) and \(d = 1\). Then
    \begin{equation*}10 = k(1)(1^2)\end{equation*}
    so \(k = 10\). The formula for load as a function of width and depth is
    \begin{equation*}L = 10wd^2\end{equation*}
    You can check that this formula works for all the values in the table.

\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-tiling-floor}

    We next consider another important family of functions, called \terminology{exponential functions}. These functions describe growth by a constant factor in equal time periods. Exponential functions model many familiar processes, including the growth of populations, compound interest, and radioactive decay.
%
\par

    In 1965, Gordon Moore, the cofounder of Intel, observed that the number of transistors on a computer chip had doubled every year since the integrated circuit was invented. Moore predicted that the pace would slow down a bit, but the number of transistors would continue to double every 2 years. More recently, data density has doubled approximately every 18 months, and this is the current definition of Moore's law. Most experts, including Moore himself, expect Moore's law to hold for at least another two decades.

\subsection[Exponential Growth]{Exponential Growth}\label{subsection-85}

    The functions in Investigation 7 describe exponential growth. During each time interval of a fixed length, the population is multiplied by a certain constant amount. In Part A, the bacteria population grows by a factor of \(3\) every day.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth,]{images/fig-table-bacteria-population.pdf}\end{figure}
\par

    For this reason, we say that \(3\) is the \terminology{growth factor} for the function. Functions that describe exponential growth can be expressed in a standard form.
%
\begin{definition}[Exponential Growth]\label{definition-7}
%
\par

    The function
    \begin{equation*}P(t) = P_0 b^t\end{equation*}
    models exponential growth.
%
\par

    \(P_0 = P(0)\) is the \terminology{initial value} of \(P\);
%
\par

    \(b\) is the \terminology{growth factor}.
%
\end{definition}
\par

    For the bacteria population, we have
    \begin{equation*}P(t) = 100 \cdot 3^t\end{equation*}
    so \(P_0 = 100\) and \(b = 3\).

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-608}{}The initial value of the population was \(P_0 = 300\), and its weekly growth factor is \(b = 2\). Thus, a formula for the population after \(t\) weeks is

    In Part B of Investigation 7, the rabbit population grew by a factor of \(2\) every \(3\) months.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth,]{images/fig-table-rabbit-population.pdf}\end{figure}
\par

    To write the growth formula for this population, we divide the value of \(t\) by \(3\) to find the number of doubling periods.
    \begin{equation*}P(t) = 60 \cdot 2^{t/3}\end{equation*}
    To see the growth factor for the function, we use the third law of exponents to write \(2^{t/3}\) in another form. Recall that to raise a power to a power, we multiply exponents, so
    \begin{equation*}\left(2^{1/3}\right)^t = 2^{t (1/3)} = 2^{t/3}\end{equation*}
    The growth law for the rabbit population is thus
    \begin{equation*}P(t) = 60 \cdot \left(2^{1/3}\right)^t\end{equation*}
    The initial value of the function is \(P_0 = 60\), and the growth factor is \(b = 2^{1/3}\), or approximately \(1.26\). The rabbit population grows by a factor of about \(1.26\) every month.
%
\par

    If the units are the same, a population with a larger growth factor grows faster than one with a smaller growth factor.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-compare-growth-factors}

    A lab technician compares the growth of \(2\) species of bacteria. She starts \(2\) colonies of \(50\) bacteria each. Species A doubles in population every \(2\) days, and species B triples every \(3\) days. Find the growth factor for each species.
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    A function describing the growth of species A is
    \begin{equation*}P(t) = 50 \cdot 2^{t/2} = 50 \cdot \left(\alert{2^{1/2}}\right)^t\end{equation*}
    so the growth factor for species A is \(\alert{2^{1/2}}\), or approximately \(1.41\). For species B,
    \begin{equation*}P(t) = 50 \cdot 3^{t/3} = 50 \cdot \left(\alert{3^{1/3}}\right)^t\end{equation*}
     so the growth factor for species B is \(\alert{3^{1/3}}\), or approximately \(1.44\). Species B grows faster than species A.

\typeout{Subsection 4.1.3 Percent Increase}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Percent Increase]{Percent Increase}\label{subsection-87}

    Exponential growth occurs in other circumstances, too. For example, if the interest on a savings account is compounded annually, the amount of money in the account grows exponentially.
%
\par

    Consider a principal of \textdollar{}100 invested at 5\% interest compounded annually. At the end of \(1\) year, the amount is
    \begin{align*}
    \text{Amount} \amp = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \\
    A \amp = P + Pr\\
    \amp = 100 + 100(0.05) = 105
    \end{align*}
    It will be more useful to write the formula for the amount after \(1\) year in factored form.
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = P + Pr \amp\amp \text{Factor out P.} \\
    \amp = P(1 + r)
    \end{align*}
    With this version of the formula, the calculation for the amount at the end of \(1\) year looks like this:
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = P(1 + r ) \\
    \amp = 100(1 + 0.05) \\
    \amp = 100(1.05) = \alert{105}
    \end{align*}
%
\par

    The amount, \textdollar{}105, becomes the new principal for the second year. To find the amount at the end of the second year, we apply the formula again, with \(P = 105\).
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = P(1 + r ) \\
    \amp = 105(1 + 0.05) \\
    \amp = \alert{105}(1.05) = 110.25
    \end{align*}
    Observe that to find the amount at the end of each year, we multiply the principal by a factor of \(1 + r = 1.05\). Thus, we can express the amount at the end of the second year as
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = [100(1.05)](1.05) \\
    \amp = 100(1.05)^2
    \end{align*}
    and at the end of the third year as
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = \left[100(1.05)^2\right](1.05) \\
    \amp = 100(1.05)^3

    In general, for an initial investment of \(P\) dollars at an interest rate \(r\) compounded annually, we have the following formula for the amount accumulated after \(t\) years.

    The \terminology{amount A(t)} accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account bearing interest compounded annually is
    \begin{equation*}A(t) = P(1 + r)^t\end{equation*}
    where 
    \begin{align*}
    \amp P \amp\amp \text{is the principal invested,} \\
    \amp r \amp\amp \text{is the interest rate,} \\
    \amp t \amp\amp \text{is the time period, in years.}
    \end{align*}
%
\par

    This function describes exponential growth with an initial value of \(P\) and a growth factor of \(b = 1 + r\). The interest rate \(r\), which indicates the \terminology{percent increase} in the account each year, corresponds to a \terminology{growth factor} of \(1 + r\). The notion of percent increase is often used to describe the growth factor for quantities that grow exponentially.

\subsection[Decay Factors]{Decay Factors}\label{subsection-89}

    Before \hyperref[example-inflation]{Example~\ref{example-inflation}}, we noted that a percent increase of \(r\) (in decimal form) corresponds to a growth factor of \(b = 1 + r\). A percent decrease of \(r\) corresponds to a decay factor of \(b = 1 − r\). In Part B of Investigation 8, each millimeter of plastic reduced the amount of light by \(25\)\%, so \(r = 0.25\), and the decay factor for the function \(P(x)\) is
    \begin{align*}
    b \amp = 1 − r \\
    \amp= 1 − 0.25 = 0.75

    \(L\) is a linear function with initial value \(5\) and slope \(2\); \(E\) is an exponential function with initial value \(5\) and growth factor \(2\). In a way, the growth factor of an exponential function is analogous to the slope of a linear function: Each measures how quickly the function is increasing (or decreasing). However, for each unit increase in \(t\), \(2\) units are \emph{added} to the value of \(L(t)\), whereas the value of \(E(t)\) is \emph{multiplied} by \(2\). An exponential function with growth factor \(2\) eventually grows much more rapidly than a linear function with slope \(2\), as you can see by comparing the graphs in \hyperref[fig-linear-vs-exponential]{Figure~\ref{fig-linear-vs-exponential}} or the function values in  \hyperref[table-linear]{Tables~\ref{table-linear}} and \hyperref[table-exponential]{\ref{table-exponential}}.

\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-652}{}
            Let \(L(t)\) represent the company's total sales \(t\) years after starting business, where \(t = 0\) is the first year of operation. If sales grow linearly, then \(L(t)\) has the form \(L(t) = mt + b\). Now \(L(0) = 80,000\), so the intercept \(b\) is \(80,000\). The slope \(m\) of the graph is
            \begin{equation*}
                \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t}= 
                \frac{8000 \text{ dollars}}{1\text{ year}}= 
                8000 \text{ dollars/year}
            \end{equation*}
            where \(\Delta S = 8000\) is the increase in sales during the first year. Thus, \(L(t) = 8000t + 80,000\), and sales grow by adding \textdollar{}\(8000\) each year. The expected sales total for the next year is
            \begin{equation*}
                L(2) = 8000(2) + 80,000 = 96,000
            \end{equation*}
            The values of \(L(t)\) for \(t=0\) to \(t=4\) are shown in the middle column of \hyperref[table-linear-exponential]{Table~\ref{table-linear-exponential}}. The linear graph of \(L(t)\) is shown in \hyperref[fig-linear-vs-exponential2]{Figure~\ref{fig-linear-vs-exponential2}}.
        \item\hypertarget{li-653}{}
            Let \(E(t)\) represent the company's sales assuming that sales will grow exponentially. Then \(E(t)\) has the form \(E(t) = E_0b^t\) . The percent increase in sales over the first year was \(r = 0.10\), so the growth rate is
            \begin{equation*}b = 1 + r = 1.10\end{equation*}
            The initial value, \(E_0\), is \(80,000\). Thus, \(E(t) = 80,000(1.10)^t\), and sales grow by being multiplied each year by \(1.10\). The expected sales total for the next year is
            \begin{equation*}
                E(2) = 80,000(1.10)^2= 96,800
            \end{equation*}

\section[Exponential Functions]{Exponential Functions}\label{Exponential-Functions}

	In \hyperref[Exponential-Growth-and-Decay]{Section~\ref{Exponential-Growth-and-Decay}}, we studied functions that describe exponential growth or decay. More formally, we define an \terminology{exponential function} as follows,
%
\begin{definition}[Exponential Function]\label{definition-9}
\begin{equation*}f(x) = ab^x \text{, where } b \gt 0 \text{ and } b \ne 1 \text{, } a \ne 0\end{equation*}\end{definition}
\par

	Some examples of exponential functions are
	\begin{equation*}f (x) = 5^x \text{, } P(t) = 250(1.7)^t \text{, and } g(n) = 2.4(0.3)^n\end{equation*}
	The constant \(a\) is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph because
	\begin{equation*}f (0) = a \cdot b^0 = a \cdot 1 = a\end{equation*}
	For the examples above, we find that the \(y\)-intercepts are
	\begin{align*}
	f(0) \amp= 5^0 = 1 \text{,} \\
	P(0) \amp= 250(1.7)^0 = 250\text{, and} \\
	g(0) \amp= 2.4(0.3)^0 = 2.4
	\end{align*}
%
\par

	The positive constant \(b\) is called the \terminology{base} of the exponential function. We do not allow \(b\) to be negative, because if \(b \lt 0\), then \(b^x\) is not a real number for some values of \(x\). For example, if \(b = −4\) and \(f (x) = (−4)^x\), then \(f (1/2) = (−4)^{1/2}\) is an imaginary number. We also exclude \(b = 1\) as a base because \(1^x = 1\) for all values of \(x\); hence the function \(f (x) = 1^x\) is actually the constant function \(f (x) = 1\).

	In \hyperref[table-exp-growth]{Table~\ref{table-exp-growth}} you can see that as the \(x\)-values decrease toward negative infinity, the corresponding \(y\)-values decrease toward zero. As a result, the graph of \(f\) decreases toward the \(x\)-axis as we move to the left. Thus, the negative \(x\)-axis is a horizontal asymptote for exponential functions with \(b \gt 1\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-exponential-growth-and-decay]{Figure~\ref{fig-exponential-growth-and-decay}}a. For exponential functions with \(0 \lt b \lt 1\), the positive \(x\)-axis is an asymptote, as illustrated in \hyperref[fig-exponential-growth-and-decay]{Figure~\ref{fig-exponential-growth-and-decay}}b. (See \hyperref[basic-functions]{Section~\ref{basic-functions}} to review asymptotes.)

\par

	In \hyperref[example-two-exponential-growth]{Example~\ref{example-two-exponential-growth}}, we compare two increasing exponential functions. The larger the value of the base, \(b\), the faster the function grows. In this example, both functions have \(a = 1\).

	The graph of \(g\) is the reflection of the graph of \(f\) about the \(y\)-axis. We can see why this is true by writing the formula for \(g(x)\) in another way:
	\begin{equation*}g(x) =\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x= \left(2^{−1}\right)^x = 2^{−x}\end{equation*}
	We see that \(g(x)\) is the same function as \(f (−x)\). Replacing \(x\) by \(−x\) in the formula for a function switches every point \(( p, q)\) on the graph with the point \((−p, q)\) and thus reflects the graph about the \(y\)-axis.

	First, compare the values for these two functions in \hyperref[table-power-vs-exponential]{Table~\ref{table-power-vs-exponential}}. The scaling exponent for \(h(x)\) is \(3\), so that when \(x\) doubles, say, from \(1\) to \(2\), the output is multiplied by \(2^3\), or \(8\). On the other hand, we can tell that \(f\) is exponential because its values increase by a factor of \(3\) for each unit increase in \(x\). (To see this, divide any function value by the previous one. For example, \(54 \div 18 = 3\), and \(18 \div 6 = 3\).)

	As you would expect, the graphs of the two functions are also quite different.

(See \hyperref[fig-power-vs-exponential-1]{Figure~\ref{fig-power-vs-exponential-1}}) From the table, we see that \(h(3) = f(3) = 54\), so the two graphs intersect at \(x = 3\). (They also intersect at approximately \(x = 2.48\).) However, if you compare the values of \(h(x) = 2x^3\) and \(f(x) = 2(3^x)\) for larger values of \(x\), you will see that eventually the exponential function overtakes the power function, as shown in \hyperref[fig-power-vs-exponential-2]{Figure~\ref{fig-power-vs-exponential-2}}.

\subsection[Exponential Equations]{Exponential Equations}\label{subsection-94}

	An \terminology{exponential equation} is one in which the variable is part of an exponent. For example, the equation
	\begin{equation*}3^x = 81\end{equation*}
	is exponential. Many exponential equations can be solved by writing both sides of the equation as powers with the same base. To solve the above equation, we write
	\begin{equation*}3^x = 3^4\end{equation*}
	which is true if and only if \(x = 4\). In general, if two equivalent powers have the same base, then their exponents must be equal also, as long as the base is not \(0\) or \(\pm 1\).
%
\par

	Sometimes the laws of exponents can be used to express both sides of an equation as single powers of a common base.

	%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
	Let \(P\) represent the number of fleas present after \(t\) days. The original population of \(10\) is multiplied by a factor of \(2\) every \(5\) days, or
	\begin{equation*}P(t) = 10 \cdot 2^{t/5}\end{equation*}
	Set \(P = \alert{10,240}\) and solve for \(t\):
	\begin{align*}
	\alert{10,240} \amp = 10\cdot 2^{t/5}\amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by 10.} \\
	1024 \amp = 2^{t/5} \amp\amp \text {Write 1024 as a power of 2.} \\
	2^{10} \amp = 2^{t/5}
	\end{align*}
	Equate the exponents to get \(10 = \frac{t}{5}\), or \(t = 50\). The population will grow to \(10,240\) fleas in \(50\) days.

\subsection[Graphical Solution of Exponential Equations]{Graphical Solution of Exponential Equations}\label{subsection-95}

	It is not always so easy to express both sides of the equation as powers of the same base. In the following sections, we will develop more general methods for finding exact solutions to exponential equations. But we can use a graphing calculator to obtain approximate solutions.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-gc-exponential-equation}

	Use the graph of \(y = 2^x\) to find an approximate solution to the equation \(2^x = 5\) accurate to the nearest hundredth.
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
	Enter \(Y_1 = 2\) \lstinline?^? X and use the standard graphing window (\lstinline?ZOOM? 6) to obtain the graph shown in \hyperref[fig-GC-exponential-equation]{Figure~\ref{fig-GC-exponential-equation}}a. We are looking for a point on this graph with \(y\)-coordinate \(5\). Using the TRACE feature, we see that the \(y\)-coordinates are too small when \(x \lt 2.1\) and too large when \(x \gt 2.4\). 
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.100\textwidth,]{images/fig-GC-exponential-equation.pdf}\caption{\label{fig-GC-exponential-equation}}
\end{figure}
\par

	The solution we want lies somewhere between \(x = 2.1\) and \(x = 2.4\), but this approximation is not accurate enough. To improve our approximation, we will use the \terminology{intersect} feature. Set \(Y_2 = 5\) and press \lstinline?GRAPH?. The \(x\)-coordinate of the intersection point of the two graphs is the solution of the equation \(2^x = 5\) Activating the \terminology{intersect} command results in \hyperref[fig-GC-exponential-equation]{Figure~\ref{fig-GC-exponential-equation}}b, and we see that, to the nearest hundredth, the solution is \(2.32\).
%
\par

	We can verify that our estimate is reasonable by substituting into the equation:
	\begin{equation*}2^{2.32}  \stackrel{?}{=} 5\end{equation*}
	We enter 2 \lstinline?^? 2.32 \lstinline?ENTER? to get \(4.993322196\). This number is not equal to \(5\), but it is close, so we believe that \(x = 2.32\) is a reasonable approximation to the solution of the equation \(2^x = 5\).
%
\end{example}

\section[Logarithms]{Logarithms}\label{Logarithms}

	In this section, we introduce a new mathematical tool called a \emph{logarithm}, which will help us solve exponential equations.
%
\par

	Suppose that a colony of bacteria doubles in size every day. If the colony starts with \(50\) bacteria, how long will it be before there are \(800\) bacteria? We answered questions of this type in \hyperref[Exponential-Functions]{Section~\ref{Exponential-Functions}} by writing and solving an exponential equation. The function
	\begin{equation*}P(t) = 50 \cdot 2^t\end{equation*}
	gives the number of bacteria present on day \(t\), so we must solve the equation
	\begin{equation*}800 = 50 \cdot 2^t\end{equation*}
	Dividing both sides by 50 yields
	\begin{equation*}16 = 2^t\end{equation*}
	The solution of this equation is the answer to the following question: To what power must we raise \(2\) in order to get \(16\)?
%
\par

	The value of \(t\) that solves the equation is called the base \(2\) \terminology{logarithm} of \(16\). Since \(2^4 = 16\), the base \(2\) logarithm of \(16\) is \(4\). We write this as
	\begin{equation*}\log_{2}16 = 4\end{equation*}
	In other words, we solve an exponential equation by computing a logarithm. You can check that \(t = \alert{4}\)
	solves the problem stated above:
	\begin{equation*}P(\alert{4}) = 50 \cdot 2^\alert{4}= 800\end{equation*}
%
\par

	Thus, the unknown exponent is called a logarithm. In general, for positive values of \(b\) and \(x\), we make the following definition.
%
\begin{definition}[Logarithm]\label{definition-10}

	The \terminology{base \(b\) logarithm of \(x\)}, written \(\log_{b} x\), is the exponent to which \(b\) must be raised in order to yield \(x\).
\end{definition}
\par

	It will help to keep in mind that a logarithm is just an exponent. Some logarithms, like some square roots, are easy to evaluate, while others require a calculator. We will start with the easy ones.

		\begin{equation*}\log_3 9 = 2 \text{ because } 3^2 = 9\end{equation*}

	We use logarithms to solve exponential equations, just as we use square roots to solve quadratic equations. Consider the two equations
	\begin{equation*}x^2 = 25 ~ \text{ and } ~ 2^x = 8\end{equation*}
	We solve the first equation by taking a square root, and we solve the second equation by computing a logarithm:
	\begin{equation*}x = \pm\sqrt{25} = \pm 5 ~ \text{ and } ~ x = \log_{2}{8} = 3\end{equation*}
	The operation of taking a base \(b\) logarithm is the inverse operation for raising the base \(b\) to a power, just as extracting square roots is the inverse of squaring a number.
%
\par

	Every exponential equation can be rewritten in logarithmic form by using the conversion equations. Thus,
	\begin{equation*}3 = \log_{2}{8} \text{ and } 8 = 2^3\end{equation*}
	are equivalent statements, just as
	\begin{equation*}5 = \sqrt{25} \text{ and } 25 = 5^2\end{equation*}

	Suppose we would like to solve the equation
	\begin{equation*}2^x = 26\end{equation*}
	The solution of this equation is \(x = \log_{2}{26}\), but can we find a decimal approximation for this value? There is no integer power of \(2\) that equals \(26\), because
	\begin{align*}
	2^4 \amp = 16 \\
	\text{and } 2^5 \amp = 32
	\end{align*} 
	Thus, \(\log_{2}{26}\) must be between \(4\) and \(5\). We can use trial and error to find the value of \(\log_{2}{26}\) to the nearest tenth. Use your calculator to make a table of values for \(y = 2^x\), starting with \(x = 4\) and using increments of \(0.1\).

\par

	From \hyperref[table-decimal-powers-of-two]{Table~\ref{table-decimal-powers-of-two}}, we see that \(26\) is between \(24.7\) and \(24.8\), and is closer to \(24.7\). To the nearest tenth, \(\log_{2}{26} \approx 4.7\).
%

	Trial and error can be a time-consuming process. In Example 4, we illustrate a graphical method for estimating the value of a logarithm.

\begin{example}[]\label{example-approximate-log}

	Approximate \(\log_{3}{7}\) to the nearest hundredth.
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
	If \(\log_{3}{7}=x\), then \(3^x = 7\). We will use the graph of \(y = 3^x\) to approximate a solution to \(3^x = 7\). Graph \(Y_1 =3\)\lstinline?^? X and \(Y_2 = 7\) in the standard window (\lstinline?ZOOM? 6) to obtain the graph shown in \hyperref[fig-GC-approx-log]{Figure~\ref{fig-GC-approx-log}}. Activate the intersect feature to find that the two graphs intersect at the point \((1.7712437, 7)\). Because this point lies on the graph of \(y = 3^x\) , we know that
	\begin{equation*}31.7712437 \approx 7\text{, or } \log_{3}{7} \approx 1.7712437\end{equation*}
	To the nearest hundredth, \(\log_{3}{7} \approx 1.77\).

\subsection[Base 10 Logarithms]{Base 10 Logarithms}\label{subsection-98}

	Some logarithms are used so frequently in applications that their values are programmed into scientific and graphing calculators. These are the base \(10\) logarithms, such as 
	\begin{equation*}\log_{10}{1000} = 3 ~\text{ and }~ \log_{10}{0.01} = −2\end{equation*}
	Base \(10\) logarithms are called \terminology{common logarithms}, and the subscript \(10\) is often omitted, so that \(\log x\) is understood to mean \(\log_{10}{x}\).
%
\par

	To evaluate a base \(10\) logarithm, we use the \lstinline?LOG? key on a calculator. Many logarithms are irrational numbers, and the calculator gives as many digits as its display allows. We can then round off to the desired accuracy.
