\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
Mathematics, as we all know, is the language of science, and fluency in algebraic skills has always been necessary for anyone aspiring to disciplines based on calculus. But in the information age, increasingly sophisticated mathematical methods are used in all fields of knowledge, from archaeology to zoology. Consequently, there is a new focus on the courses before calculus. The availability of calculators and computers allows students to tackle complex problems involving real data, but requires more attention to analysis and interpretation of results. All students, not just those headed for science and engineering, should develop a mathematical viewpoint, including critical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and estimation, in addition to computational skills. \emph{Modeling, Functions and Graphs} employs a variety of applications to motivate mathematical thinking.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .1 MODELING}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[MODELING]{MODELING}\label{section-1}
The ability to model problems or phenomena by algebraic expressions and equations is the ultimate goal of any algebra course. Through a variety of applications, we motivate students to develop the skills and techniques of algebra. Each chapter includes an interactive Investigation that gives students an opportunity to explore an openended modeling problem. These Investigations can be used in class as guided explorations or as projects for small groups. They are designed to show students how the mathematical techniques they are learning can be applied to study and understand new situations.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .2 Functions}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[Functions]{Functions}\label{section-2}
The fundamental concept underlying calculus and related disciplines is the notion of function, and students should acquire a good understanding of functions before they embark on their study of college-level mathematics. While the formal study of functions is usually the content of precalculus, it is not too early to begin building an intuitive understanding of functional relationships in the preceding algebra courses. These ideas are useful not only in calculus but in practically any field students may pursue. We begin working with functions in Chapter 1 and explore the different families of functions in subsequent chapters.%
\par
In all our work with functions and modeling we employ the “Rule of Four,” that all
problems should be considered using algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal methods.
It is the connections between these approaches that we have endeavored to establish in this course. At this level it is crucial that students learn to write an algebraic expression from a verbal description, recognize trends in a table of data, and
extract and interpret information from the graph of a function.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .3 Graphs}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[Graphs]{Graphs}\label{section-3}
No tool for conveying information about a system is more powerful than a graph. Yet many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more
global view. By taking advantage of graphing calculators, we examine a large number of examples and study them in more detail than is possible when every graph is plotted by hand. We can consider more realistic models in which calculations by more traditional methods are difficult or impossible.%
\par
We have incorporated graphing calculators into the text wherever they can be used to enhance understanding. Calculator use is not simply an add-on, but in many ways shapes
the organization of the material. The text includes instructions for the TI-84 graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility. We have not attempted to use all the features of the calculator or to teach calculator use for its own sake, but in all cases have let the mathematics suggest how technology should be used.%

You may have heard that mathematics is the language of science.  In fact, professionals in nearly every discipline take advantage of mathematical methods to analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change.  This process is called \terminology{mathematical modeling}.  A model is a simplified representation of reality that helps us understand a process or phenomenon.  Because it is a simplification, a model can never be completely accurate.  Instead, it should focus on those aspects of the real situation that will help us answer specific questions. Here is an example. %
\par
The world's population is growing at different rates in different nations.  Many factors, including economic and social forces, influence the birth rate.  Is there a connection between birth rates and education levels?  The figure shows the birth rate plotted against the female literacy rate in 148 countries.  Although the data points do not all lie precisely on a line, we see a generally decreasing trend:  the higher the literacy rate, the lower the birth rate.  The \terminology{regression line} provides a model for this trend, and a tool for analyzing the data.  In this chapter we study the properties of linear models and some techniques for fitting a linear model to data.%

Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment. He will be paid \textdollar{}1000 per month plus a 6\% commission on his sales. The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about \textdollar{}8000 worth of equipment per month. To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations.%

\subsection[Tables, Graphs and Equations]{Tables, Graphs and Equations}\label{subsection-1}
The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between variables.  In Investigation 1 {$\langle\langle$investigation-commission$\rangle\rangle$}, we analyzed the relationship between Delbert's sales and his income.  Starting from the verbal description of his income, we represented the relationship by a table of values, a graph, and an algebraic equation.  Each of these mathematical tools is useful in a different way.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-10}{}A \terminology{table of values} displays specific data points with precise numerical values.%
\item\hypertarget{li-11}{}A \terminology{graph} is a visual display of the data.  It is easier to spot trends and describe the overall behavior of the variables from a graph.%
\item\hypertarget{li-12}{}An \terminology{algebraic equation} is a compact summary of the model.  It can be used to analyze the model and to make predictions%
\end{enumerate}
\par
We begin our study of modeling with some examples of \terminology{linear models}.  In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools, and how each contributes to the model.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-Annelise}
Annelise is on vacation at a seaside resort.  She can rent a bicycle from her hotel for \textdollar{}3 an hour, plus a \textdollar{}5 insurance fee.  (A fraction of an hour is charged as the same fraction of \textdollar{}3.)%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-13}{}Make a table of values showing the cost, \(C\), of renting a bike for various lengths of time, \(t\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-14}{}Plot the points on a graph.  Draw a curve through the data points%
.
                        \item\hypertarget{li-15}{}Write an equation for \(C\) in terms of \(t\).%
\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-16}{}To find the cost, multiply the time by \textdollar{}3, and add the result to the \textdollar{}5 insurance fee.  For example, the cost of a 1-hour bike ride is
                            \begin{align*}
\text{Cost}\amp=(\$5\text{ insurance fee})+(\$3\text{ per hour})\times(\alert{1}\text{ hour})\\
C\amp=5+3(\alert{1})=8
\end{align*}
                            A 1-hour bike ride costs \textdollar{}8.  Record the results in a table, as shown here:%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{AcAcAcAcA}\hrulethick
Length of rental (hours)%
&Cost of rental (dollars)%
&&\((t,C)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
1&8&\(C=5+3(\alert{1})\)&\((1,8)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
2&11&\(C=5+3(\alert{2})\)&\((2,11)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
3&14&\(C=5+3(\alert{3})\)&\((3,14)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\item\hypertarget{li-17}{}Each pair of values represents a point on the graph.  The first value gives the horizontal coordinate of the point, and the second value gives the vertical coordinate.  The points lie on a straight line, as shown in the figure.  The line extends infinitely in only one direction, because negative values of \(t\) do not make sense here.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth,]{images/fig-Annelise-1.svg}\end{figure}
\item\hypertarget{li-18}{}To find an equation, let \(C\) represent the cost of the rental, and use \(t\) for the number of hours:
        \begin{align*}
\text{Cost}\amp=(\$5\text{ insurance fee})+(\$3\text{ per hour})\times\text{(number of hours)}\\
C\amp=5+3\cdot t=8
\end{align*} %
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-6hrbike}
Use the equation \(C=5+3\cdot t\) you found in \hyperref[example-Annelise]{Example~\ref{example-Annelise}} to answer the following questions.  Then show how to find the answers by using the graph.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-19}{}How much will it cost Annelise to rent a bicycle for 6 hours?%
\item\hypertarget{li-20}{}How long can Annelise bicycle for \textdollar{}18.50?%
\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-21}{}Substitute \(t=\alert{6}\) into the expression for \(C\) to find \begin{equation*}C=5+3(\alert{6})=23\end{equation*}A 6-hour bike ride will cost \textdollar{}23.  The point \(P\) on the graph in the figure represents the cost of a 6-hour bike ride.  The value on the \(C\)-axis at the same height as point \(P\) is 23, so a 6-hour bike ride costs \textdollar{}23.%
\item\hypertarget{li-22}{}Substitute \(C=\alert{18.50}\) into the equation and solve for \(t\).
        \begin{align*}
\alert{18.50}\amp=5+3t\\
13.50\amp=3t\\

\subsection[Choosing Scales for the Axes]{Choosing Scales for the Axes}\label{subsection-2}
To draw a useful graph, we must choose appropriate scales for the axes.  They must extend far enough to show the values of the variables, and the tick marks should be equally spaced.  Usually no more than 10 or 15 tick marks are needed.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-home-price}
In 1990, the median home price in the US was \textdollar{}92,000.  The median price increased by about \textdollar{}4700 per year over the next decade.

\item\hypertarget{li-29}{} Write an equation that expresses \(P\) in terms of \(t\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-30}{} How much did the price of the house increase from 1990 to 1996?  Illustrate the increase on your graph.%

        In 1998 the price had increased by \(\alert{8}(4700)=37,600\)  dollars, so
        \begin{equation*}P=92,000+\alert{8}(4700)-129,600\end{equation*}

\item\hypertarget{li-33}{}Look back at the calculations in part (a).  The price of the house started at \textdollar{}92,000 in 1990 and increased by \(t \times 4700\) dollars after \(t\) years.  Thus,

The increase in price is the difference of the two \(P\)-values.

All the models in these examples have equations with a similar form:  \begin{equation*}y=\text{(starting value)}+\text{(rate of change)}\cdot x\end{equation*}
(We'll talk more about rate of change in Section 1.4.)  Their graphs were all portions of straight lines.  For this reason such equations are called \terminology{linear equations}.  The order of the terms in the equation does not matter.

The examples in this section model simple linear relationships between two variables.
Such relationships, in which the value of one variable is determined by the value of the
other, are called \terminology{functions}. We will study various kinds of functions throughout the course.%

\subsection[Definition of Function]{Definition of Function}\label{subsection-6}

    We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For example, when a physician prescribes a drug in a certain dosage, she needs to know how long the dose will remain in the bloodstream. A sales manager needs to know how the price of his product will affect its sales. A \terminology{function} is a special type of relationship between variables that allows us to make such predictions.%
\par

    Suppose it costs \textdollar{}800 for flying lessons, plus \textdollar{}30 per hour to rent a plane. If we let \(C\) represent the total cost for t hours of flying lessons, then
    \begin{equation*}C=800+305t ~~~~ (t\ge 0)\end{equation*}
    Thus, for example
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rll}
when&\(t=\alert{0}\),&\(C=800+30(\alert{0})=800\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
when&\(t=\alert{4}\),&\(C=800+30(\alert{4})=920\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
when&\(t=\alert{10}\),&\(C=800+30(\alert{10})=1100\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par

    The variable \(t\) is called the \terminology{input} or \terminology{independent} variable, and \(C\) is the \terminology{output} or \terminology{dependent} variable, because its values are determined by the value of \(t\). We can display the relationship between two variables by a table or by ordered pairs. The input variable is the first component of the ordered pair, and the output variable is the second component.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{AcAcAcA}\hrulethick
\(t\)%
&\(C\)%
&\((t,C)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(0\)&\(800\)&\((0, 800)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(4\)&\(920\)&\((4, 920)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(10\)&\(1100\)&\((10,1100)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par

    For this relationship, we can find the value \(C\) of associated with any given value of \(t\). All we have to do is substitute the value of \(t\) into the equation and solve for \(C\). The result has no ambiguity: Only one value for \(C\) corresponds to each value of \(t\). This type of relationship between variables is called a \terminology{function}. In general, we make the following definition.
%
\begin{definition}\label{definition-function}
Definition of Function%
\par
A \terminology{function} is a relationship between two variables for which a unique value of the \terminology{output} variable can be determined from a value of the \terminology{input} variable.
    %
\end{definition}
\par

    What distinguishes functions from other variable relationships? The definition of a function calls for a \emph{unique value}—that is, \emph{exactly one value} of the output variable corresponding to each value of the input variable. This property makes functions useful in applications because they can often be used to make predictions.

According to these data, cholesterol count is \emph{not} a function of age, because several patients who are the same age have different cholesterol levels. For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a \emph{unique} value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a person’s cholesterol count.%

As of 2016,  One World Trade Center in New York City is the nation’s tallest building, at 1776 feet.

\typeout{Subsection 1.2.5 Function Notation}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Function Notation]{Function Notation}\label{subsection-10}
There is a convenient notation for discussing functions. First, we choose a letter, such as \(f\), \(g\), or \(h\) (or \(F\), \(G\), or \(H\)), to name a particular function. (We can use any letter, but these are
the most common choices.) For instance, in \hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}}, the height, \(h\), of a falling algebra book is a function of the elapsed time, \(t\). We might call this function \(f\). In other words, \(f\) is the name of the relationship between the variables \(h\) and \(t\). We write 
\begin{equation*}h = f (t)\end{equation*}
which means "\(h\) is a function of \(t\), and \(f\) is the name of the function."%
\par
The new symbol \(f(t)\), read "\(f\) of \(t\)," is another name for the height, \(h\). The parentheses in the symbol \(f(t)\) do not indicate multiplication. (It would not make sense to multiply the name of a function by a variable.) Think of the symbol \(f(t)\) as a single variable that represents
the output value of the function.%
\par
With this new notation we may write
\begin{equation*}h = f (t) = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
or just
\begin{equation*}f (t) = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
instead of
\begin{equation*}h = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
to describe the function.%
\par
Perhaps it seems complicated to introduce a new symbol for \(h\), but the notation \(f(t)\) is very useful for showing the correspondence between specific values of the variables \(h\) and \(t\).
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-falling-book-2}
In \hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}}, the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of the Sears Tower is given by the equation
    \begin{equation*}h = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
We see that%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{l}
when \(t=1\)&&\(h=1760\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
when \(t=2\)&&\(h=1712\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par
Using function notation, these relationships can be expressed more concisely as%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
\(f(1)=1760\)& and &\(f(2)=1712\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par
which we read as "\(f\) of 1 equals 1760" and "\(f\) of 2 equals 1712." The values for the input variable, \(t\), appear \emph{inside} the parentheses, and the values for the output variable, \(h\), appear on the other side of the equation.%
\end{example}
\par
Remember that when we write \(y = f(x)\), the symbol \(f(x)\) is just another name for the output variable.%

The graph in \hyperref[fig-DJIA]{Figure~\ref{fig-DJIA}}  shows the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (the average value of the stock prices of 500 major companies) during the stock market correction of October 1987. The Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is given as a function of time during the 8 days from October 15 to October 22; that is, \(f(t)\) is the DJIA recorded at noon on day \(t\).
%
\leavevmode%

\end{figure}
\par
The values of the input variable, time, are displayed on the horizontal axis, and the values of the output variable, DJIA, are displayed on the vertical axis. There is no formula that gives the DJIA for a particular day; but it is still a function, defined by its graph. The value of \(f(t)\) is specified by the vertical coordinate of the point with the given t-coordinate.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-DJIA}
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-117}{}The coordinates of point \(P\) in \hyperref[fig-DJIA]{Figure~\ref{fig-DJIA}} are \((15, 2412)\). What do the coordinates tell you about the function \(f\)?\item\hypertarget{li-118}{}If the DJIA was 1726 at noon on October 20, what can you say about the graph of \(f\)?\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-119}{}The coordinates of point P tell us that \(f(15) = 2412\), so the DJIA was 2412 at noon on October 15.\item\hypertarget{li-120}{}We can say that \(f(20) = 1726\), so the point \((20, 1726)\) lies on the graph of \(f\). This point is labeled \(Q\) in \hyperref[fig-DJIA]{Figure~\ref{fig-DJIA}}.\end{enumerate}

Thus, the coordinates of each point on the graph of the function represent a pair of corresponding
values of the two variables. In general, we can make the following statement.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-125}{}To find \(g(−2)\), we look for the point with \(t\)-coordinate \(−2\). The point \((−2, 0)\) lies on the graph of \(g\), so \(g(−2) = 0\). Similarly, the point \((5, 1)\) lies on the graph, so \(g(5) = 1\).\item\hypertarget{li-126}{}We look for points on the graph with \(y\)-coordinate \(−2\). Because the points \((−5, −2)\), \((−3, −2)\), and \((3, −2)\) lie on the graph, we know that \(g(−5) = −2\), \(g(−3) = −2\), and \(g(3) = −2\). Thus, the \(t\)-values we want are \(−5\), \(−3\), and \(3\).\item\hypertarget{li-127}{}The highest point on the graph is \((1, 4)\), so the largest \(y\)-value is \(4\). Thus, the maximum value of \(g(t)\) is \(4\), and it occurs when \(t = 1\).\item\hypertarget{li-128}{}A graph is increasing if the \(y\)-values get larger as we read from left to right. The graph of \(g\) is increasing for \(t\)-values between \(−4\) and \(1\), and between \(3\) and \(5\). Thus, \(g\) is increasing on the intervals \((−4, 1)\) and \((3, 5)\).\end{enumerate}

Consider the graph shown in \hyperref[fig-vertical-line-test]{Figure~\ref{fig-vertical-line-test}}a.

In \hyperref[fig-vertical-line-test]{Figure~\ref{fig-vertical-line-test}}b, however, the line \(x = 2\) intersects the graph at two points, \((2, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\).

You can verify algebraically that \(x = \alert{2}\) and \(y = \alert{7}\) satisfy the equation: 
    \begin{equation*}\text{Does }~\alert{7} = 2 (\alert{2}) + 3\text{? Yes}\end{equation*}
    We can also say that \(x = 2\) is a solution of the one-variable equation \(2x + 3 = 7\). In fact, we can use the graph of \(y = 2x + 3\) to solve the equation \(2x + 3 = k\) for any value of \(k\). Thus, we can use graphs to find solutions to equations in one variable.}%

Begin by locating the point \(P\) on the graph for which \(y = 150\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve}}. Now find the \(x\)-coordinate of point \(P\) by drawing an imaginary line from \(P\) straight down to the \(x\)-axis. The \(x\)-coordinate of \(P\) is \(x = 9\). Thus, \(P\) is the point \((9,150)\), and \(x = 9\) when \(y = 150\). The solution of the equation \(150 = 285 − 15x\) is \(x = 9\). You can verify the solution algebraically by substituting \(x = \alert{9}\) into the equation:%

Does \(150 = 285 − 15(\alert{9})\)? %

In a similar fashion, we can solve inequalities with a graph. Consider again the graph of \(y = 2x + 3\), shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve3]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve3}}. We saw that \(x = 2\) is the solution of the equation \(2x + 3 = 7\). When we use \(x = 2\) as the input for the function \(f(x) = 2x + 3\), the output is \(y = 7\). Which input values for \(x\) produce output values greater than \(7\)? You can see in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve3]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve3}} that \(x\)-values greater than \(2\) produce \(y\)-values greater than \(7\), because points on the graph with \(x\)-values greater than \(2\) have \(y\)-values greater than \(7\). Thus, the solutions of the inequality \(2x + 3 \gt 7\) are \(x\gt 2\). You can verify this result by solving the inequality algebraically.}%

\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We begin by locating the point \(P\) on the graph for which \(y = 150\) and \(x = 9\) (its \(x\)-coordinate). Now, because \(y = 285 − 15x\) for points on the graph, the inequality \(285 − 15x \gt 150\) is equivalent to \(y \gt 150\). So we are looking for points on the graph with \(y\)-coordinate greater than \(150\). These points are shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve-inequality]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve-inequality}}.

Which is more expensive, a 64-ounce bottle of Velvolux dish soap that costs \textdollar{}3.52, or a 60-ounce bottle of Rainfresh dish soap that costs \textdollar{}3.36?%
\par
You are probably familiar with the notion of comparison shopping. To decide which dish soap is the better buy, we compute the unit price, or price per ounce, for each bottle. The unit price for Velvolux is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{352 \text{ cents}}{64 \text{ ounces}}= 5.5 \text{ cents per ounce}\end{equation*}
and the unit price for Rainfresh is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{336 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ ounces}}= 5.6 \text{ cents per ounce}\end{equation*}
%
\par

    The Velvolux costs less per ounce, so it is the better buy. By computing the price of each brand for \emph{the same amount of soap}, it is easy to compare them.%
\par

    In many situations, a ratio, similar to a unit price, can provide a basis for comparison. \hyperref[example-rate-of-growth]{Example~\ref{example-rate-of-growth}} uses a ratio to measure a rate of growth.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-rate-of-growth}
Which grow faster, Hybrid A wheat seedlings, which grow 11.2 centimeters in 14 days, or Hybrid B seedlings, which grow 13.5 centimeters in 18 days?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We compute the growth rate for each strain of wheat. Growth rate is expressed as a ratio, \(\frac{\text{centimeters}}{\text{days}}\), or centimeters per day. The growth rate for Hybrid A is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{11.2 \text{ centimeters}}{14 \text{ days}}= 0.8 \text{ centimeters per day}\end{equation*}
and the growth rate for Hybrid B is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{13.5 \text{ centimeters}}{18 \text{ days}}= 0.75 \text{ centimeters per day}\end{equation*}
Because their rate of growth is larger, the Hybrid A seedlings grow faster.
\end{example}
\par

    By computing the growth of each strain of wheat seedling over the same unit of time, a single day, we have a basis for comparison. In this case, the ratio \(\frac{\text{centimeters}}{\text{day}}\) measures the rate of growth of the wheat seedlings.

\end{exercise}
\par

    In \hyperref[exercise-gas-mileage]{Exercise~\ref{exercise-gas-mileage}}, the ratio \(\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}\) measures the rate at which each car uses gasoline. By computing the mileage for each car for the same amount of gas, we have a basis for comparison. We can use this same idea, finding a common basis for comparison, to measure the steepness of an incline.

But what exactly is steepness? It is not merely the gain in altitude, because even a gentle incline will reach a great height eventually. Steepness measures how sharply the altitude increases.

To compare the steepness of two inclined paths, we compute the ratio of change in
altitude to change in horizontal distance for each path.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-steep-trail}
Which is steeper, Stony Point trail, which climbs 400 feet over a horizontal distance of 2500 feet, or Lone Pine trail, which climbs 360 feet over a horizontal distance of 1800 feet?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad For each trail, we compute the ratio of vertical gain to horizontal distance. For Stony Point trail, the ratio is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{400 \text{ feet}}{2500 \text{ feet}}= 0.16 \end{equation*}  
    and for Lone Pine trail, the ratio is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{360 \text{ feet}}{1800 \text{ feet}}= 0.20 \end{equation*} 
    Lone Pine trail is steeper, because it has a vertical gain of 0.20 foot for every foot traveled horizontally. Or, in more practical units, Lone Pine trail rises 20 feet for every 100 feet of horizontal distance, whereas Stony Point trail rises only 16 feet over a horizontal distance of 100 feet.%

    To compare the steepness of the two trails in \hyperref[example-steep-trail]{Example~\ref{example-steep-trail}}, it is not enough to know which trail has the greater gain in elevation overall. Instead, we compare their elevation gains over the same horizontal distance. Using the same horizontal distance provides a basis for comparison. The two trails are illustrated in \hyperref[fig-trail-climb-grid]{Figure~\ref{fig-trail-climb-grid}} as lines on a coordinate grid.

    For example, as we travel along the line representing Stony Point trail, we move from the point\(0, 0)\) to the point \((2500, 400)\). The \(y\)-coordinate changes by \(400\) and the \(x\)-coordinate changes by \(2500\), giving the ratio \(0.16\) that we found in \hyperref[example-steep-trail]{Example~\ref{example-steep-trail}}2.

    The slope of a line is a number. It tells us how much the \(y\)-coordinates of points on the line increase when we increase their \(x\)-coordinates by 1 unit. For instance, the slope \(\frac{3}{4}\) in \hyperref[example-slope-grid]{Example~\ref{example-slope-grid}} means that the \(y\)-coordinate increases by \(\frac{3}{4}\) unit when the \(x\)-coordinate increases by 1 unit. For increasing graphs, a larger slope indicates a greater increase in altitude, and hence a steeper line.

\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        As we move from the point \(P(−4, 2)\) to the point \(Q(5, −1)\), we move \(3\) units \emph{down}, so \(\Delta y = −3\). We then move \(9\) units to the right, so \(\Delta x = 9\).
        Thus, the slope is
        \begin{equation*}m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{-3}{9}=\frac{-1}{3}\end{equation*}\(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta x\) are labeled on the graph.

    We can move from point to point in either direction to compute the slope. The line graphed in \hyperref[example-negative-slope]{Example~\ref{example-negative-slope}} decreases as we move from left to right and hence has a negative slope. The slope is the same if we move from point \(Q\) to point \(P\) instead of from \(P\) to \(Q\). (See \hyperref[fig-negative-slope2]{Figure~\ref{fig-negative-slope2}}.) In that case, our computation looks like this:
        \begin{equation*}m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{3}{-9}=\frac{-1}{3}\end{equation*}
        \(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta x\) are labeled on the graph.

No matter which two points we use to calculate the slope, we will always get the same result. We will see later that lines are the only graphs that have this property.

    What does this value mean for the cost of renting a bicycle? The expression

    If we increase the length of the rental by 3 hours, the cost of the rental increases by 9 dollars. The slope gives the rate of increase in the rental fee, 3 dollars per hour. In general, we can make the following statement.

    We have defined the slope of a line to be the ratio \(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\) as we move from one point to another on the line. So far, we have computed \(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta x\) by counting squares on the graph, but this method is not always practical. All we really need are the coordinates of two points on the graph.
%
\par
We will use \terminology{subscripts} to distinguish the two points:%
\par
\(P_1\) means \emph{first point} and \(P_2\) means \emph{second point}.%
\par
We denote the coordinates of \(P_1\) by \((x_1, y_1)\) and the coordinates of \(P_2\) by \((x_2, y_2)\).

        Now consider a specific example. The line through the two points \(P_1 (2, 9)\) and \(P_2 (7,−6)\) is shown in \hyperref[fig-slope-formula]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-formula}}. We can find \(\Delta x\) by subtracting the \(x\)-coordinates of the points: 
        \begin{equation*}\Delta x = 7 − 2 = 5 \end{equation*}
        In general, we have 
        \begin{equation*}\Delta x = x_2 − x_1 \end{equation*}
        and similarly
        \begin{equation*}\Delta y = y_2 − y_1 \end{equation*}
    }%
}% end body 
{}% caption

\par

    These formulas work even if some of the coordinates are negative; in our example 
    \begin{equation*}\Delta y = y_2 − y_1 = −6 − 9 = −15\end{equation*}
    By counting squares \emph{down} from \(P_1\) to \(P_2\), we see that \(\Delta y\) is indeed \(−15\). The slope of the line in \hyperref[fig-slope-formula]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-formula}} is %

    The starting value, or the value of \(y\) at \(x = 0\), is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. Thus, we can write the equation of a line as
    \begin{equation*}f (x) = b + mx\end{equation*}
    where the constant term, \(b\), is the \(y\)-intercept of the line, and \(m\), the coefficient of \(x\)., is the slope of the line. This form for the equation of a line is called the \terminology{slope-intercept form}.

    We can see that the \(y\)-intercept of each line is given by the constant term, \(b\). By examining the table of values, we can also see why the coefficient of \(x\)gives the slope of the line: 
    For \(f (x)\), each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) decreases by \(3\) units. For \(g(x)\), each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) increases by \(2\) units. For each graph, the coefficient of \(x\) is a scale factor that tells us how many units \(y\) changes for \(1\) unit increase in \(x\). But that is exactly what the slope tells us about a line.

That is, the values of \(m\) and \(b\) determine the particular line. The value of \(b\) gives us a starting point, and the value of \(m\) tells us which direction to go to plot a second point. Thus, we can graph a line given in slope-intercept form without having to make a table of values.

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-164}{}We solve the equation for \(y\) in terms of \(x\).
            \begin{align*}
                −3y \&=6 − 4x\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}

        \item\hypertarget{li-165}{}We see that the slope of the line is \(m = \frac{4}{3}\) and its \(y\)-intercept is \(b = −2\). We begin by plotting the \(y\)-intercept, \((0, −2)\). We then use the slope to find another point on the line. We have
        \begin{equation*}m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{4}{3}\end{equation*}
        so starting at \((0, −2)\), we move \(4\) units in the \(y\)-direction and \(3\) units in the \(x\)-direction, to arrive at the point \((3, 2)\). Finally, we draw the line through these two points. (See \hyperref[fig-slope-intercept]{\ref{fig-slope-intercept}}.)\end{enumerate}

The slope of a line is a ratio and can be written in many equivalent ways. In \hyperref[example-slope-intercept]{Example~\ref{example-slope-intercept}}, the slope is equal to \(\frac{8}{6}\), \(\frac{12}{9}\), and \(\frac{−4}{−3}\). We can use any of these fractions to locate a third
point on the line as a check. If we use \(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \frac{−4}{−3}\), we move down \(4\) units and left \(3\) units from the \(y\)-intercept to find the point \((−3, −6)\) on the line.%

        We can also use the slope-intercept form to find the equation of a line from its graph. First, note the value of the \(y\)-intercept from the graph, and then calculate the slope using two convenient points.

            The line crosses the \(y\)-axis at the point \((0, 3200)\), so the \(y\)-intercept is \(3200\). To calculate the slope of the line, locate another point, say \((20, 6000)\), and compute:

    We can find the equation for a line if we know its slope and \(y\)-intercept. What if we do not know the \(y\)-intercept, but instead know some other point on the line? There is only one line that passes through a given point and has a given slope. For example, we can graph the line of slope \(\frac{−3}{4}\) that passes through the point \((1, −4)\). }%
}% end body 
{}% caption 
\popValignCaptionBottom
\end{figure}
We first plot the given point, \((1, −4)\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-point-slope]{Figure~\ref{fig-point-slope}}. Then we use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is
        \begin{equation*}m =\frac{−3}{4}= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\end{equation*}
    so we move down \(3\) units and then \(4\) units to the right, starting from \((1, −4)\). This brings us to the point \((5, −7)\). We can then draw the line through these two points.%
\par
We can also find an equation for the line, as shown in Example 4.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-point-slope}
Find an equation for the line that passes through \((1, −4)\) and has slope \(\frac{−3}{4}\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We will use the formula for slope,
    \begin{equation*}m = \frac{y_2 − y_1}{x_2 − x_1}\end{equation*}
    We substitute \(\frac{−3}{4}\) for the slope, \(m\), and \((1, −4)\) for \((x_1, y_1)\). For the second point, \((x_2, y_2)\), we will use the variable point \((x, y)\). Substituting these values into the slope formula gives us
    \begin{equation*}\frac{−3}{4}= \frac{y − (−4)}{x − 1}=\frac{y + 4}{x − 1}\end{equation*}
    To solve for \(y\) we first multiply both sides by \(x − 1\).
    \begin{align*}
                \alert{(x-1)}\frac{−3}{4}\&
                =\frac{y +4}{x − 1}\alert{(x-1)} \&\&\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                \frac{−3}{4}(x-1)\&=y+4  \&\&\text{Apply the distributive law.}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                \frac{−3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}\&=y+4   \&\& 
                \text{Subtract 4 from both sides.}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                \frac{−3}{4}x-\frac{13}{4}\&=y \&\& \frac{3}{4}-4=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{16}{4}=\frac{-13}{4}
    \end{align*}
\end{example}
\par

    When we use the slope formula in this way to find the equation of a line, we substitute a variable point \((x, y)\) for the second point. This version of the formula, 
    \begin{equation*}m = \frac{y − y_1}{x − x_1}\end{equation*}
    is called the \terminology{point-slope form} for a linear equation. It is sometimes stated in another form obtained by clearing the fraction to get
    \begin{align*}
                \alert{(x−x_1)}m\&
                =\frac{y -y_1}{x − x_1}\alert{(x−x_1)} \&\&
                \text{Multiply both sides by }(x − x_1)\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                (x − x_1) m\&=y-y_1  \&\&\text{Clear fractions and solve for }y\text{.}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}

    We have spent most of this chapter analyzing models described by graphs or equations. To create a model, however, we often start with a quantity of data. Choosing an appropriate function for a model is a complicated process. In this section, we consider only linear models and explore methods for fitting a linear function to a collection of data points. First, we fit a line through two data points.

\subsection[Fitting a Line through Two Points]{Fitting a Line through Two Points}\label{subsection-28}

    If we already know that two variables are related by a linear function, we can find a formula from just two data points. For example, variables that increase or decrease at a constant rate can be described by linear functions.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-wine}
In 1993, Americans drank 188.6 million cases of wine. Wine consumption increased at a constant rate over the next decade, and we drank 258.3 million cases of wine in 2003. (Source: Los Angeles Times, Adams Beverage Group)%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-179}{}Find a formula for wine consumption, \(W\), in millions of cases, as a linear function of time, \(t\), in years since 1990.\item\hypertarget{li-180}{}State the slope as a rate of change. What does the slope tell us about this problem?\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-181}{}We have two data points of the form \((t, W)\), namely \((3, 188.6)\) and \((13, 258.3)\). We use the point-slope formula to fit a line through these two points. First, we compute the slope.
        \begin{equation*}\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}=\frac {258.3 − 188.6}{13 − 3}= 6.97\end{equation*}
        Next, we use the slope m = \(6.97\) and either of the two data points in the point-slope formula.
        \begin{align*}
            W\&=W_1 + m(t − t_1)\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
            W\&= 188.6 + 6.97(t − 3)\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
            W\&= 167.69 + 6.97t
        \end{align*}

        Thus, \(W = f (t) = 167.69 + 6.97t\).
        \item\hypertarget{li-182}{}The slope gives us the rate of change of the function, and the units of the variables can help us interpret the slope in context.
        \begin{equation*}\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}= 
            \frac{258.3 − 188.6 \text{millions of cases}}{13 − 3\text{ years}}
                = 6.97 millions of cases /year
        \end{equation*}
        Over the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, wine consumption in the United States increased at a rate of 6.97 million cases per year.\end{enumerate}

The points on the scatterplot in \hyperref[fig-BMI]{Figure~\ref{fig-BMI}} show the BMI of Miss America from 1918 to 1998. From the data in the scatterplot, can we see a trend in Americans’ ideal of female beauty?

    Human brains consume a large amount of energy, about 16 times as much as muscle tissue per unit weight. In fact, brain metabolism accounts for about 25\% of an adult human’s energy needs, as compared to about 5\% for other mammals. As hominid species evolved, their brains required larger and larger amounts of energy, as shown in \hyperref[fig-hominid-brains]{Figure~\ref{fig-hominid-brains}}.

    The process of predicting an output value based on a straight line that fits the data is called \terminology{linear regression}, and the line itself is called the \terminology{regression line}. The equation of the regression line is usually used (instead of a graph) to predict values.%

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-201}{}We first calculate the slope by choosing two points on the regression line we drew in \hyperref[fig-BMI2]{Figure~\ref{fig-BMI2}}. The points we choose are not necessarily any of the original data points; instead they should be points on the regression line itself. The line appears to pass through the points \((17, 20)\) and \((67, 18)\). The slope of the line is then
        \begin{equation*}m = \frac{18 − 20}{67 − 17}\approx −0.04\end{equation*}
        Now we use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line. (If you need to review the point-slope formula, see \hyperref[linear-functions]{Section~\ref{linear-functions}}.) We substitute \(m = −0.04\) and use either of the two points for \((x_1, y_1)\); we will choose \((17, 20)\). The equation of the regression line is
        \begin{align*}
        y \&= y_1 + m(x − x_1)\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
        y \&= 20−0.04(x−17)

\subsection[Linear Interpolation and Extrapolation]{Linear Interpolation and Extrapolation}\label{subsection-31}

        Using a regression line to estimate values between known data points is called \terminology{interpolation}. Making predictions beyond the range of known data is called \terminology{extrapolation}.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-BMI-extrapolation}

\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-205}{}Use linear interpolation to estimate the BMI of Miss America 1960.\item\hypertarget{li-206}{}Use linear extrapolation to predict the BMI of Miss America 2001.\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-207}{}For 1960, we substitute \(t = 40\) into the regression equation we found in \hyperref[example-BMI-regression]{Example~\ref{example-BMI-regression}}. 
        \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(40) = 19.08\end{equation*} 
        We estimate that Miss America 1960 had a BMI of 19.08. (Her BMI was actually 18.79.)\item\hypertarget{li-208}{}For 2001, we substitute \(t = 81\) into the regression equation. 
        \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(81) = 17.44\end{equation*}\end{enumerate}
Our model predicts that Miss America 2001 had a BMI of 17.44. In fact, her BMI was 20.25. By the late 1990s, public concern over the self-image of young women had led to a reversal of the trend toward ever-thinner role models.%
\end{example}
\par

    \hyperref[example-BMI-extrapolation]{Example~\ref{example-BMI-extrapolation}}b illustrates an important fact about extrapolation: If we try to extrapolate too far, we may get unreasonable results. For example, if we use our model to predict the BMI of Miss America 2520 (when \(t = 600\)), we get 
    \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(600) =−3.32\end{equation*}
    Even if the Miss America pageant is still operating in 600 years, the winner cannot have a negative BMI. Our linear model provides a fair approximation for 1920–1990, but if we try to extrapolate too far beyond the known data, the model may no longer apply.

    We can also use interpolation and extrapolation to make estimates for nonlinear functions. Sometimes a variable relationship is not linear, but a portion of its graph can be approximated by a line. The graph in \hyperref[fig-Emily-height]{Figure~\ref{fig-Emily-height}} shows a child’s height each month. The graph is not linear because her rate of growth is not constant; her growth slows down as she approaches her adult height. However, over a short time interval the graph is close to a line, and that line can be used to approximate the coordinates of points on the curve.

    Estimating a line of best fit is a subjective process. Rather than base their estimates on such a line, statisticians often use the \terminology{least squares regression line}. This regression line minimizes the sum of the squares of all the vertical distances between the data points and the corresponding points on the line (see \hyperref[fig-least-squares]{Figure~\ref{fig-least-squares}}). Many calculators are programmed to find the least squares regression line, using an algorithm that depends only on the data, not on the appearance of the graph.

            A contagious disease whose spread is unchecked can devastate a confined population. For example, in the early sixteenth century Spanish troops introduced smallpox into the Aztec population in Central America, and the resulting epidemic contributed significantly to the fall of Montezuma’s empire. Suppose that an outbreak of cholera follows severe flooding in an isolated town of 5000 people. Initially (on Day 0), 40 people are infected.

    When studying nonlinear models, we will need to solve nonlinear equations. For example, in Investigation 3 we used a graph to solve the quadratic equation 
    \begin{equation*}18x − x^2 = 80\end{equation*} 
    Here is another example. \hyperref[fig-parabola]{Figure~\ref{fig-parabola}} shows a table and graph for the function \(y = 2x^2 − 5\).

\(y\)&\(13\)&\(3\)&\(-3\)&\(-5\)&\(-3\)&\(3\)&\(13\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

    You can see that there are two points on the graph for each \(y\)-value greater than \(−5\). For example, the two points with \(y\)-coordinate \(7\) are shown. To solve the equation 
    \begin{equation*}2x^2 − 5 = 7\end{equation*} 
    we need only find the x-coordinates of these points. From the graph, the solutions appear to be about 2.5 and −2.5.
%
\par

    How can we solve this equation algebraically? The opposite operation for squaring a number is taking a square root. So we can undo the operation of squaring by extracting square roots. We first solve for \(x^2\) to get
    \begin{align}
    2x^2 \amp= 12 \\
    x^2 \amp= 6\\
    \end{align}
    and then take square roots to find
    \begin{equation*}x = \pm\sqrt{6}\end{equation*}
%
\par

    Don't forget that every positive number has two square roots. The symbol \(\pm\) (read “plus or minus”) is a shorthand notation used to indicate both square roots of \(6\). The exact solutions are thus \(\sqrt{6}\) and \(-\sqrt{6}\). We can also find decimal approximations for the solutions using a calculator. Rounded to two decimal places, the approximate solutions are \(2.45\) and \(−2.45\).
%
\par

    In general, wecan solve equations of the form 
    \(ax^2 + c = 0\)
    by isolating \(x^2\) on one side of the equation and then taking the square root of each side. This method for solving equations is called \terminology{extraction of roots}.

    We can use extraction of roots to solve many formulas involving the square of the variable.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-volume-cone}
The formula \(V = \frac{1}{3} πr^2h\) gives the volume of a cone in terms of its height and radius. Solve the formula for \(r\) in terms of \(V\) and \(h\).
    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    Because the variable we want is squared, we use extraction of roots. First, multiply both sides by \(3\) to clear the fraction.
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{align*}
        3V \amp = 3(\frac{1}{3} πr^2h)\\
        3V \amp = πr^2h \amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by } πh.\\
        \frac{3V}{πh}\amp= r^2 \amp\amp \text{Take square roots.}\\
        \pm\sqrt{\frac{3V}{πh}}\amp= r
        \end{align*}
    \end{equation*}
    Because the radius of a cone must be a positive number, we use only the positive square root: 
    \(r = \sqrt{\frac{3V}{πh}}\).

\subsection[More Extraction of Roots]{More Extraction of Roots}\label{subsection-34}

    Equations of the form
    \begin{equation*}a( px + q)^2 + r = 0\end{equation*}
    can also be solved by extraction of roots after isolating the squared expression, \((px + q)^2\).
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-extracting-roots}

    Solve the equation \(3(x − 2)^2 = 48\).
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    First, isolate the perfect square, \((x − 2)^2\).
    
        \begin{aligned}
        3(x − 2)^2 \amp = 48 \amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by }3.\\
        (x − 2)^2 \amp = 16 \amp\amp\text{Take the square root of each side.}\\
        x − 2 \amp = \pm\sqrt{16} = \pm 4
        \end{aligned}
    
        This gives us two equations for \(x\),

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Compound Interest and Inflation]{Compound Interest and Inflation}\label{subsection-35}

    Many savings institutions offer accounts on which the interest is \emph{compounded annually}. At the end of each year, the interest earned is added to the principal, and the interest for the next year is computed on this larger sum of money.
%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  Compound Interest}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Compound Interest]{Compound Interest}\label{paragraphs-22}

    If interest is compounded annually for \(n\) years, the amount, \(A\), of money in an account is given by
    \begin{equation*}A = P(1 + r)^n\end{equation*}
    where \(P\) is the principal and \(r\) is the interest rate, expressed as a decimal fraction.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-compound-interest}

    Carmella invests \textdollar{}3000 in an account that pays an interest rate, \(r\), compounded annually.
    \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-249}{}Write an expression for the amount of money in Carmella’s account after two years.\item\hypertarget{li-250}{}What interest rate would be necessary for Carmella's account to grow to \textdollar{}3500 in two years?\end{enumerate}

%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-251}{}Use the formula above with \(P = 3000\) and \(n = 2\). Carmella’s account balance will be
            \begin{equation*}A = 3000(1 + r)^2\end{equation*}\item\hypertarget{li-252}{}Substitute \(3500\) for \(A\) in the equation.
        \begin{equation*}\alert{3500} = 3000(1 + r)^2\end{equation*}
        We can solve this equation in \(r\) by extraction of roots. First, isolate the perfect square.
        \begin{align}
        3500 \amp = 3000(1 + r )^2 \amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by 3000.} \\
        1.1\overline{6} \amp = (1 + r )^2 \amp\amp \text{Take the square root of both sides.} \\
        \pm 1.0801 \amp\approx 1 + r \amp\amp \text{Subtract 1 from both sides.}
        r \amp\approx 0.0801 \amp\amp \text{or }\amp r \approx −2.0801
        \end{align}
        Because the interest rate must be a positive number, we discard the negative solution. Carmella needs an account with interest rate \(r \approx 0.0801\), or just over 8\%, to achieve an account balance of \textdollar{}3500 in two years.\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\par

    The formula for compound interest also applies to the effects of inflation. For instance, if there is a steady inflation rate of 4\% per year, in two years an item that now costs \textdollar{}100 will cost
    \begin{align}
    A \amp= P(1 + r)^2\\
    \amp = 100(1 + 0.04)2 = \$108.16
    \end{align}
%
\begin{exercise}\label{exercixe-inflation}

    Two years ago, the average cost of dinner and a movie was \textdollar{}24. This year the average cost is \textdollar{}25.44. What was the rate of inflation over the past two years?

    Because squaring and taking square roots are opposite operations, we can solve the equation
    \begin{equation*}\sqrt{x} = 8.2\end{equation*}
    by squaring both sides to get
    \begin{align}
    (\sqrt{x})^2 \amp= 8.2^2 \\
    x \amp = 67.24
    \end{align}
    Similarly, we can solve
    \begin{equation*}x^3 = 258\end{equation*}
    by taking the cube root of both sides, because cubing and taking cube roots are opposite operations. Rounding to three places, we find 
    \begin{align}
    \sqrt[3]{x^3}\amp=258\\
    x \amp \approx 6.366
    \end{align}
    The notion of undoing operations can help us solve a variety of simple nonlinear equations. The operation of taking a reciprocal is its own opposite, so we solve the equation
    \begin{equation*}\frac{1}{x} = 50\end{equation*}
    by taking the reciprocal of both sides to get
    \begin{equation*}x = \frac{1}{50}= 0.02\end{equation*}

\begin{example}[]\label{example-nonlinear-equation}

        Solve \(\frac{3}{x − 2}= 4\).
    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We begin by taking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation to get
    \begin{equation*}\frac{x − 2}{3}= \frac{1}{4}\end{equation*}
    We continue to undo the operations in reverse order. Multiply both sides by \(3\).
    \begin{align}
    x − 2 \amp = \frac{3}{4} \amp\amp \text{Add 2 to both sides.}\\
    x \amp = 2 + \frac{3}{4}= \frac{11}{4} \amp\amp \frac{2}{1}=\frac{8}{4}
    \text{, so } \frac{2}{1}+ \frac{3}{4}=\frac{8}{4}+\frac{3}{4}=\frac{11}{4}

    The solution is \(\frac{11}{4}\), or \(2.75\).

    \text{Ymin} \amp = −10 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 10
    \end{align}
    The point where the two graphs intersect locates the solution of the equation. If we trace along the graph of \(Y_1\), the closest we can get to the intersection point is \((2.8, 3.75)\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-GC-nonlinear]{Figure~\ref{fig-GC-nonlinear}}a. We get a better approximation using the \emph{intersect} feature.

    We begin by reviewing the absolute value.
%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 2.2.1 Absolute Value}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Absolute Value]{Absolute Value}\label{subsection-37}

    The absolute value is used to discuss problems involving distance. For example, consider the number line in \hyperref[fig-abs-six]{Figure~\ref{fig-abs-six}}. Starting at the origin, we travel in opposite directions to reach the two numbers \(6\) and \(−6\), but the distance we travel in each case is the same.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth,]{images/fig-abs-six.svg}\caption{\label{fig-abs-six}}
\end{figure}
\par

    The distance from a number \(c\) to the origin is called the \terminology{absolute value} of \(c\), denoted by \(\abs{c}\). Because distance is never negative, the absolute value of a number is always positive (or zero). Thus, \(\abs{6}= 6\) and \(\abs{−6} = 6\). In general, we define the absolute value of a number \(x\) as follows.
%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  Absolute Value}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Absolute Value]{Absolute Value}\label{paragraphs-23}

   The absolute value of x is defined by
   \begin{equation*}
    \abs{x} =
    \begin{cases}
    x \amp \text{if } x\ge 0\\
    -x  \amp \text{if } x\lt 0
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
%
\par

    This definition says that the absolute value of a positive number (or zero) is the same as the number. To find the absolute value of a negative number, we take the opposite of the number, which results in a positive number. For instance,
    \begin{equation*}\abs{−6} = −(−6) = 6\end{equation*}
    Absolute value bars act like grouping devices in the order of operations: You should complete any operations that appear inside absolute value bars before you compute the absolute value.

        The graphs of the eight basic functions considered in Investigation 4 are shown in \hyperref[fig-basic-a-c]{Figure~\ref{fig-basic-a-c}}, \hyperref[fig-basic-d-f]{Figure~\ref{fig-basic-d-f}}, and \hyperref[fig-basic-g-h]{Figure~\ref{fig-basic-g-h}}. Once you know the shape of each graph, you can sketch an accurate picture by plotting a few guidepoints and drawing the curve through those points. Usually, points (or vertical asymptotes!) at \(x = −1\), \(0\), and \(1\) make good guidepoints.

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Properties of the Basic Functions]{Properties of the Basic Functions}\label{subsection-40}

    In \hyperref[functions]{Section~\ref{functions}}, we saw that for most functions, \(f (a + b)\) is not equal to \(f (a) + f (b)\). We may be able to find some values of \(a\) and \(b\) for which \(f (a + b) = f (a) + f (b)\) is true, but not for all values of \(a\) and \(b\). If there is even one value of \(a\) or \(b\) for which \(f (a + b)\) is not equal to \(f (a) + f (b)\), we cannot claim that \(f (a + b) = f (a) + f (b)\) for that function. For example, for the function \(f (x) = x^2\), if we choose \(a = 3\) and \(b = 4\), then
    \begin{align*}
f (3 + 4) \amp = f (7) = 7^2 = 49\\
\text{but }~ f (3) + f (4) \amp = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
\end{align*}
    so we have proved that \(f (a + b) \ne f (a) + f (b)\) for the squaring function. (In fact, we already knew this because \((a + b)^2 \ne a^2 + b^2\) as long as neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is \(0\).)
%
\par

    What about multiplication? Which of the basic functions have the property that \(f (ab) = f (a) f (b)\) for all \(a\) and \(b\)? You will consider this question in the homework problems, but in particular you will need to recall the following  roperties of absolute
value.

\abs{a + b} \le \abs{a} + \abs{b} \amp\amp \text{Triangle inequality}\\
\abs{a  b} = \abs{a}  \abs{b} \amp\amp \text{Multiplicative property }
\end{align}%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-triangle-inequality}

        Verify the triangle inequality for three cases: \(a\) and \(b\) are both positive, \(a\) and \(b\) are both negative, and \(a\) and \(b\) have opposite signs.
    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We choose positive values for \(a\) and \(b\), say \(a = 3\) and \(b = 5\). Then 
    \begin{equation*}\abs{3 + 5} = \abs{8} = 8 ~\text{ and } ~ \abs{3}+\abs{5}= 3 + 5 = 8\end{equation*}
    so \(\abs{3 + 5} = \abs{3} + \abs{5}\). For the second case, we choose \(a = −3\) and \(b = −5\). Then
    \begin{equation*}\abs{−3 + (−5)} = \abs{−8} = 8 ~\text{ and } ~ \abs{−3}+\abs{−5} = 3 + 5 = 8\end{equation*}
    so \(\abs{−3 + (−5)} =\abs{−3}+\abs{−5}\). For the third case, we choose \(a = 3\) and \(b = −5\). Then
    \begin{equation*}\abs{3 + (−5)}=\abs{−2} = 2  ~\text{ and } ~ \abs{3}+\abs{−5}=3 + 5 = 8\end{equation*}
    so \(\abs{3 + (−5)} \lt \abs{3}+\abs{−5}\). In each case, \(\abs{a + b}\le\abs{a} +\abs{b}\).
\end{example}
\par

    Note that \emph{verifying} a statement for one or two values of the variables does not \emph{prove} the statement is true for \emph{all} values of the variables. However, working with examples can help us understand the meaning and significance of mathematical properties.

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Functions Defined Piecewise]{Functions Defined Piecewise}\label{subsection-41}

        A function may be defined by different formulas on different portions of the \(x\)-axis. Such a function is said to be defined \terminology{piecewise}. To graph a function defined piecewise, we consider each piece of the \(x\)-axis separately.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-piecewise}

        Graph the function defined by   
        \begin{equation*}
            f(x) =
            \begin{cases}
            x +1  \amp \text{if } x\le 1\\
            3  \amp \text{if } x\gt 1
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        Think of the plane as divided into two regions by the vertical line \(x = 1\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-piecewise]{Figure~\ref{fig-piecewise}}. In the left-hand region (\(x \le 1\)), we graph the line \(y = x + 1\). (The fastest way to graph the line is to plot its intercepts, \((−1, 0)\) and \((0, 1)\).)

We indicate this with a solid dot at the point \((1, 2)\). In the right-hand region (\(x \gt 1\)), we graph the horizontal line \(y = 3\). The value \(x = 1\) is not included in the second region, so the point \((1, 3)\) is not part of the graph. We indicate this with an open circle at the point \((1, 3)\).

    The absolute value function \(f (x) = \abs{x}\) is an example of a function that is defined piecewise.
    \begin{equation*}
        f (x) =\abs{x} =
        \begin{cases}
        x \amp \text{if } x\ge 0\\
        -x  \amp \text{if } x\lt 0
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    To sketch the absolute value function, we graph the line \(y = x\) in the first quadrant and the line \(y = −x\) in the second quadrant.

                \begin{cases}

            In the first region, \(x \ge 3\), we graph the line \(y = x − 3\). Because \(x = 3\) is included in this region, the endpoint of this portion of the graph, \((3, 0)\), is included, too. In the second region, \(x \lt 3\), we graph the line \(y = −x + 3\).

    Models for real situations are often variations of the basic functions introduced in \hyperref[basic-functions]{Section~\ref{basic-functions}}. In this section, we explore how certain changes in the formula for a function affect its graph. In particular, we will compare the graph of \(y = f (x)\) with the graphs of \(y = f (x) + k\), \(y = f (x + h)\), and \(y = a f (x)\) for different values of the constants \(k\), \(h\), and \(a\).

Compared with the graph of the basic function \(y = x^2\), the graph of \(f (x) = (x + 2)^2\) is shifted two units to the \emph{left}, as shown by the arrows. You can see why this happens by studying the function values in the table. Locate a particular \(y\)-value for \(y = x^2\), say, \(y = 1\). You must move two units to the left in the table to find the same \(y\)-value for \(f (x)\), as shown by the arrow. In fact, each \(y\)-value for \(f (x)\) occurs two units to the left when compared to the same \(y\)-value for \(y = x^2\).

But in fact, the length of a day in a particular location depends on the latitude and the time of year.

\subsection[The Shape of the Graph]{The Shape of the Graph}\label{subsection-45}

    Creating a good model for a situation often begins with deciding what kind of function to use. An appropriate model can depend on very qualitative considerations, such as the general shape of the graph. What sort of function has the right shape to describe the process we want to model? Should it be increasing or decreasing, or some combination of both? Is the slope constant or is it changing? In Examples 1 and 2, we investigate how the shape of a graph illustrates the nature of the process it models.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-home-to-school}

        Forrest leaves his house to go to school. For each of the following situations, sketch a possible graph of Forrest's distance from home as a function of time.
        \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-317}{}Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop.\item\hypertarget{li-318}{}Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop; then he waits there until the bus arrives.\item\hypertarget{li-319}{}Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop, waits there until the bus arrives, and then the bus drives him to school at a constant speed.\end{enumerate}

    %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-320}{}The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in \hyperref[fig-home-to-school]{Figure~\ref{fig-home-to-school}}a. It begins at the origin because at the instant that Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when t = 0, y = 0.) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrest’s walking speed.
            \leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.150\textwidth,]{images/fig-home-to-school.svg}\caption{\label{fig-home-to-school}}
\end{figure}
\item\hypertarget{li-321}{}The graph begins just as the graph in part (a) does. But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in \hyperref[fig-home-to-school]{Figure~\ref{fig-home-to-school}}b. The line has slope \(0\) because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is \(0\).
            \item\hypertarget{li-322}{}
                The graph begins just as the graph in part (b) does. The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in \hyperref[fig-home-to-school]{Figure~\ref{fig-home-to-school}}c.
            \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-walk-to-store}

    Erin walks from her home to a convenience store, where she buys some cat food, and then walks back home. Sketch a possible graph of her distance from home as a function of time.
\end{exercise}
\par

    The graphs in \hyperref[example-home-to-school]{Example~\ref{example-home-to-school}} are piecewise linear, because Forrest traveled at a constant rate in each segment. In addition to choosing a graph that is increasing, decreasing, or constant to model a process, we can consider graphs that bend upward or downward. The bend is called the \terminology{concavity} of the graph.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{concavity}
The two functions described in this example are both increasing functions, but they increase in different ways. Match each function to its graph in \hyperref[fig-concavity]{Figure~\ref{fig-concavity}} and to the appropriate table of values.%

        We have considered some situations that can be modeled by linear functions. In this section, we will look at a few of the other basic functions. Example 3 illustrates an application of the function \(f (x) =\sqrt{x}\).
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-sound}

    The speed of sound is a function of the temperature of the air in kelvins. (The temperature, \(T\), in kelvins is given by \(T = C + 273\), where \(C\) is the temperature in degrees Celsius.) The table shows the speed of sound, \(s\), in meters per second, at various temperatures, \(T\).

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-330}{}
            The graph of the data is shown in \hyperref[fig-speed-sound]{Figure~\ref{fig-speed-sound}}. The shape of the graph reminds us of the square root function, \(y = \sqrt{x}\).
            \leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth,]{images/fig-speed-sound.svg}\caption{\label{fig-speed-sound}}
\end{figure}
\item\hypertarget{li-331}{}
            We are looking for a value of \(k\) so that the function \(f (T ) = k \sqrt{T}\) fits the data. We substitute one of the data points into the formula and solve for \(k\). If we choose the point \((100, 200.6)\), we obtain 
            \begin{equation*}200.6 = k \sqrt{100 }\end{equation*}
            and solving for \(k\) yields \(k = 20.06\). We can check that the formula \(s = 20.06 \sqrt{T} \) is a good fit for the rest of the data points as well. Thus, we suggest the function 
            \begin{equation*}f (T ) = 20.06\sqrt{T}\end{equation*}
            as a model for the speed of sound.
        \item\hypertarget{li-332}{}First, use the model to calculate the speed of sound at a temperature of 20° Celsius. The Kelvin temperature is
            \begin{equation*}T = 20 + 273 = 293\end{equation*}
            so we evaluate \(s = f (T )\) for \(T = 293\).
            \begin{equation*}f (293) = 20.06\sqrt{293}\approx 343.4\end{equation*}
            Thus, \(s\) is approximately 343.4 meters per second.%
\par

                The lightning and the thunderclap occur simultaneously, and the speed of light is so fast (about 30,000,000 meters per second) that we see the lightning flash as it occurs. So if the sound of the thunderclap takes \(6\) seconds after the flash to reach us, we can use our calculated speed of sound to find our distance from the storm. 
                \begin{align}
                \text{distance} \amp= \text{speed} \times \text{time} \\
                \amp = (343.4\text{  m/sec}) (6 \text{ sec}) = 2060.4 \text{ meters}
                \end{align}
                The thunderstorm is \(2060\) meters, or about \(1.3\) miles, away.

\par

    At this point, a word of caution is in order. There is more to choosing a model than finding a curve that fits the data. A model based purely on the data is called an \terminology{empirical model}. However, many functions have similar shapes over small intervals of their input variables, and there may be several candidates that model the data. Such a model simply describes the general shape of the data set; the parameters of the model do not necessarily correspond to any actual process.
%
\par

    In contrast, \terminology{mechanistic models} provide insight into the biological, chemical, or physical process that is thought to govern the phenomenon under study. Parameters derived from mechanistic models are quantitative estimates of real system properties. Here is what GraphPad Software has to say about modeling:
%
\par

    "Choosing a model is a scientific decision. You should base your choice on your understanding of chemistry or physiology (or genetics, etc.). The choice should not be based solely on the shape of the graph.
%
\par

    "Some programs . . . automatically fit data to hundreds or thousands of equations and then present you with the equation(s) that fit the data best. Using such a program is appealing because it frees you from the need to choose an equation. The problem is that the program has no understanding of the scientific context of your experiment. The equations that fit the data best are unlikely to correspond to scientifically meaningful models. You will not be able to interpret the best-fit values of the variables, and the results are unlikely to be useful for data analysis.""

            An income of \(x = \alert{500}\) is in the first tax bracket, so the tax is 
            \begin{equation*}T(\alert{500}) = 0 + 0.10(\alert{500}) = 50\end{equation*} 
            The income \(x = 29,700\) is just on the upper edge of the second tax bracket. The amount over \textdollar{}7300 is \textdollar{}29,700 − \textdollar{}7300, so 
            \begin{equation*}T(\alert{29,700}) = 730 + 0.15(\alert{29,700} − 7300) = 4090\end{equation*} 
            The income \(x = 40,000\) is in the third bracket, so the tax is 
            \begin{equation*}T (\alert{40,000}) = 4090 + 0.25(\alert{40,000} − 29,700) = 6665\end{equation*}\item\hypertarget{li-339}{}
            The first two columns of the table give the tax brackets, or the \(x\)-intervals on which each piece of the function is defined. In each bracket, the tax \(T(x)\) is given by 
            \begin{equation*}\text{Base tax} + \text{Rate}\cdot(\text{Amount over bracket base}) \end{equation*}
            For example, the tax in the second bracket is 
            \begin{equation*}T (x) = 730 + 0.15(x − 7300)\end{equation*}
            Writing the formulas for each of the four tax brackets gives us
