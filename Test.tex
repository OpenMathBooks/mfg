\chapter*{Preface}\label{preface-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
Mathematics, as we all know, is the language of science, and fluency in algebraic skills has always been necessary for anyone aspiring to disciplines based on calculus. But in the information age, increasingly sophisticated mathematical methods are used in all fields of knowledge, from archaeology to zoology. Consequently, there is a new focus on the courses before calculus. The availability of calculators and computers allows students to tackle complex problems involving real data, but requires more attention to analysis and interpretation of results. All students, not just those headed for science and engineering, should develop a mathematical viewpoint, including critical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and estimation, in addition to computational skills. \emph{Modeling, Functions and Graphs} employs a variety of applications to motivate mathematical thinking.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .1 MODELING}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[MODELING]{MODELING}\label{section-1}
The ability to model problems or phenomena by algebraic expressions and equations is the ultimate goal of any algebra course. Through a variety of applications, we motivate students to develop the skills and techniques of algebra. Each chapter includes an interactive Investigation that gives students an opportunity to explore an openended modeling problem. These Investigations can be used in class as guided explorations or as projects for small groups. They are designed to show students how the mathematical techniques they are learning can be applied to study and understand new situations.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .2 Functions}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[Functions]{Functions}\label{section-2}
The fundamental concept underlying calculus and related disciplines is the notion of function, and students should acquire a good understanding of functions before they embark on their study of college-level mathematics. While the formal study of functions is usually the content of precalculus, it is not too early to begin building an intuitive understanding of functional relationships in the preceding algebra courses. These ideas are useful not only in calculus but in practically any field students may pursue. We begin working with functions in Chapter 1 and explore the different families of functions in subsequent chapters.%
\par
In all our work with functions and modeling we employ the “Rule of Four,” that all
problems should be considered using algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal methods.
It is the connections between these approaches that we have endeavored to establish in this course. At this level it is crucial that students learn to write an algebraic expression from a verbal description, recognize trends in a table of data, and
extract and interpret information from the graph of a function.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .3 Graphs}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[Graphs]{Graphs}\label{section-3}
No tool for conveying information about a system is more powerful than a graph. Yet many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more
global view. By taking advantage of graphing calculators, we examine a large number of examples and study them in more detail than is possible when every graph is plotted by hand. We can consider more realistic models in which calculations by more traditional methods are difficult or impossible.%
\par
We have incorporated graphing calculators into the text wherever they can be used to enhance understanding. Calculator use is not simply an add-on, but in many ways shapes
the organization of the material. The text includes instructions for the TI-84 graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility. We have not attempted to use all the features of the calculator or to teach calculator use for its own sake, but in all cases have let the mathematics suggest how technology should be used.%

You may have heard that mathematics is the language of science.  In fact, professionals in nearly every discipline take advantage of mathematical methods to analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change.  This process is called \terminology{mathematical modeling}.  A model is a simplified representation of reality that helps us understand a process or phenomenon.  Because it is a simplification, a model can never be completely accurate.  Instead, it should focus on those aspects of the real situation that will help us answer specific questions. Here is an example. %
\par
The world's population is growing at different rates in different nations.  Many factors, including economic and social forces, influence the birth rate.  Is there a connection between birth rates and education levels?  The figure shows the birth rate plotted against the female literacy rate in 148 countries.  Although the data points do not all lie precisely on a line, we see a generally decreasing trend:  the higher the literacy rate, the lower the birth rate.  The \terminology{regression line} provides a model for this trend, and a tool for analyzing the data.  In this chapter we study the properties of linear models and some techniques for fitting a linear model to data.%

\begin{investigation}[Sales on Commission]\label{investigation-1}
Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment. He will be paid \textdollar{}1000 per month plus a 6\% commission on his sales. The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about \textdollar{}8000 worth of equipment per month. To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations.%

\subsection[Tables, Graphs and Equations]{Tables, Graphs and Equations}\label{subsection-1}
The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between variables.  In Investigation 1 {$\langle\langle$investigation-commission$\rangle\rangle$}, we analyzed the relationship between Delbert's sales and his income.  Starting from the verbal description of his income, we represented the relationship by a table of values, a graph, and an algebraic equation.  Each of these mathematical tools is useful in a different way.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-10}{}A \terminology{table of values} displays specific data points with precise numerical values.%
\item\hypertarget{li-11}{}A \terminology{graph} is a visual display of the data.  It is easier to spot trends and describe the overall behavior of the variables from a graph.%
\item\hypertarget{li-12}{}An \terminology{algebraic equation} is a compact summary of the model.  It can be used to analyze the model and to make predictions%
\end{enumerate}
\par
We begin our study of modeling with some examples of \terminology{linear models}.  In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools, and how each contributes to the model.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-Annelise}
Annelise is on vacation at a seaside resort.  She can rent a bicycle from her hotel for \textdollar{}3 an hour, plus a \textdollar{}5 insurance fee.  (A fraction of an hour is charged as the same fraction of \textdollar{}3.)%

\subsection[Choosing Scales for the Axes]{Choosing Scales for the Axes}\label{subsection-2}
To draw a useful graph, we must choose appropriate scales for the axes.  They must extend far enough to show the values of the variables, and the tick marks should be equally spaced.  Usually no more than 10 or 15 tick marks are needed.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-home-price}
In 1990, the median home price in the US was \textdollar{}92,000.  The median price increased by about \textdollar{}4700 per year over the next decade.

\item\hypertarget{li-29}{} Write an equation that expresses \(P\) in terms of \(t\).%

The increase in price is the difference of the two \(P\)-values.

All the models in these examples have equations with a similar form:  \begin{equation*}y=\text{(starting value)}+\text{(rate of change)}\cdot x\end{equation*}

The order of the terms in the equation does not matter.

Because we really only need two points to graph a linear equation, we might as well find the intercepts first and use them to draw the graph. The values of the intercepts will also help us choose suitable scales for the axes. It is always a good idea to find a third point as a check.

The \(x\)-intercept is the point \((60, 0)\). To find the \(y\)-intercept, set \(x = \alert{0}\).%
\par

            %

The \(y\)-intercept is the point \((0, −50)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-63}{}Scale both axes in intervals of 10 and then plot the two intercepts, \((60, 0)\) and \((0, −50)\). Draw the line through them, as shown in \hyperref[fig-example-graph-intercepts]{Figure~\ref{fig-example-graph-intercepts}}. Now find another point and check that it lies on this line. We choose \(x = \alert{20}\) and solve for \(y\).
            \begin{gather*}
150(\alert{20}) −180y = 9000\\
3000 −180y = 9000\\
−180y = 6000\\
y =−33.\overline{3}
\end{gather*}

            Plot the point \((20, −33\frac{1}{3})\). Because this point lies on the line, we can be reasonably confident that our graph is correct.

The examples in this section model simple linear relationships between two variables.
Such relationships, in which the value of one variable is determined by the value of the
other, are called \terminology{functions}. We will study various kinds of functions throughout the course.%

\subsection[Definition of Function]{Definition of Function}\label{subsection-6}

    We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For example, when a physician prescribes a drug in a certain dosage, she needs to know how long the dose will remain in the bloodstream. A sales manager needs to know how the price of his product will affect its sales. A \terminology{function} is a special type of relationship between variables that allows us to make such predictions.%
\par

    Suppose it costs \textdollar{}800 for flying lessons, plus \textdollar{}30 per hour to rent a plane. If we let \(C\) represent the total cost for t hours of flying lessons, then
    \begin{equation*}C=800+305t ~~~~ (t\ge 0)\end{equation*}
    Thus, for example
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rll}
when&\(t=\alert{0}\),&\(C=800+30(\alert{0})=800\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
when&\(t=\alert{4}\),&\(C=800+30(\alert{4})=920\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
when&\(t=\alert{10}\),&\(C=800+30(\alert{10})=1100\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par

    The variable \(t\) is called the \terminology{input} or \terminology{independent} variable, and \(C\) is the \terminology{output} or \terminology{dependent} variable, because its values are determined by the value of \(t\). We can display the relationship between two variables by a table or by ordered pairs. The input variable is the first component of the ordered pair, and the output variable is the second component.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{AcAcAcA}\hrulethick
\(t\)&\(C\)&\((t,C)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(0\)&\(800\)&\((0, 800)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(4\)&\(920\)&\((4, 920)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(10\)&\(1100\)&\((10,1100)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par

    For this relationship, we can find the value \(C\) of associated with any given value of \(t\). All we have to do is substitute the value of \(t\) into the equation and solve for \(C\). The result has no ambiguity: Only one value for \(C\) corresponds to each value of \(t\). This type of relationship between variables is called a \terminology{function}. In general, we make the following definition.
%
\begin{mdframed}[style=assemblage]%
\noindent\textbf{\large Definition of Function}\label{assemblage-4}\par\medskip
A \terminology{function} is a relationship between two variables for which a unique value of the \terminology{output} variable can be determined from a value of the \terminology{input} variable.
    %
\end{mdframed}
\par

    What distinguishes functions from other variable relationships? The definition of a function calls for a \emph{unique value}—that is, \emph{exactly one value} of the output variable corresponding to each value of the input variable. This property makes functions useful in applications because they can often be used to make predictions.
%

        \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-73}{}The distance, \(d\), traveled by a car in 2 hours is a function of its speed, \(r\). If we know the speed of the car, we can determine the distance it travels by the formula \(d = r \cdot 2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-74}{}The cost of a fill-up with unleaded gasoline is a function of the number of gallons purchased. The gas pump represents the function by displaying the corresponding values of the input variable (number of gallons) and the output variable (cost).%
\item\hypertarget{li-75}{}Score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is not a function of score on an IQ test, because two people with the same score on an IQ test may score differently on the SAT; that is, a person’s score on the SAT is not uniquely determined by his or her score on an IQ test.%

When we use a table to describe a function, the first variable in the table (the left column of a vertical table or the top row of a horizontal table) is the input variable, and the second variable is the output. We say that the output variable is a function of the input.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-table-functions}

\item\hypertarget{li-78}{}\hyperref[table-auto-sales]{Table~\ref{table-auto-sales}} shows data on sales compiled over several years by the accounting office for Eau Claire Auto Parts, a division of Major Motors. In this example, the year is the input variable, and total sales is the output. We say that total sales, \(S\), is a function of \(t\).%

\par
If we know the weight of the article being shipped, we can determine the required postage from \hyperref[table-postage]{Table~\ref{table-postage}}. For instance, a catalog weighing 4.5 ounces would require \textdollar{}1.31 in postage. In this example, \(w\) is the input variable and \(p\) is the output variable. We say that \(p\) \emph{is a function of} \(w\).%

\par
According to these data, cholesterol count is \emph{not} a function of age, because several patients who are the same age have different cholesterol levels. For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a \emph{unique} value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a person’s cholesterol count.%

As of 2016,  One World Trade Center in New York City is the nation’s tallest building, at 1776 feet. If an algebra book is dropped from the top of the Sears Tower, its height above the ground after \(t\) seconds is given by the equation \begin{equation*}h = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*} Thus, after \(\alert{1}\) second the book’s height is \begin{equation*}h = 1776 − 16(\alert{1})^2 = 1760 \text{ feet}\end{equation*} After \(\alert{2}\) seconds its height is \begin{equation*}h = 1776 − 16(\alert{2})^2 = 1712 \text{ feet}\end{equation*} For this function, \(t\) is the input variable and \(h\) is the output variable.

Now press \lstinline?2nd? \lstinline?GRAPH? to see the table of values, as shown in \hyperref[fig-GC-table]{Figure~\ref{fig-GC-table}}.

\typeout{Subsection 1.2.5 Function Notation}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Function Notation]{Function Notation}\label{subsection-10}
There is a convenient notation for discussing functions. First, we choose a letter, such as \(f\), \(g\), or \(h\) (or \(F\), \(G\), or \(H\)), to name a particular function. (We can use any letter, but these are
the most common choices.) For instance, in \hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}}, the height, \(h\), of a falling algebra book is a function of the elapsed time, \(t\). We might call this function \(f\). In other words, \(f\) is the name of the relationship between the variables \(h\) and \(t\). We write 
\begin{equation*}h = f (t)\end{equation*}
which means "\(h\) is a function of \(t\), and \(f\) is the name of the function."%
\par
The new symbol \(f(t)\), read "\(f\) of \(t\)," is another name for the height, \(h\). The parentheses in the symbol \(f(t)\) do not indicate multiplication. (It would not make sense to multiply the name of a function by a variable.) Think of the symbol \(f(t)\) as a single variable that represents
the output value of the function.%
\par
With this new notation we may write
\begin{equation*}h = f (t) = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
or just
\begin{equation*}f (t) = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
instead of
\begin{equation*}h = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
to describe the function.%
\par
Perhaps it seems complicated to introduce a new symbol for \(h\), but the notation \(f(t)\) is very useful for showing the correspondence between specific values of the variables \(h\) and \(t\).
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-falling-book-2}
In \hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}}, the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of the Sears Tower is given by the equation
    \begin{equation*}h = 1776 − 16t^2\end{equation*}
We see that%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
when \(t=1\)&&\(h=1760\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
when \(t=2\)&&\(h=1712\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par
Using function notation, these relationships can be expressed more concisely as%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
\(f(1)=1760\)& and &\(f(2)=1712\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par
which we read as "\(f\) of 1 equals 1760" and "\(f\) of 2 equals 1712." The values for the input variable, \(t\), appear \emph{inside} the parentheses, and the values for the output variable, \(h\), appear on the other side of the equation.%

The graph in \hyperref[fig-DJIA]{Figure~\ref{fig-DJIA}}  shows the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (the average value of the stock prices of 500 major companies) during the stock market correction of October 1987. The Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is given as a function of time during the 8 days from October 15 to October 22; that is, \(f(t)\) is the DJIA recorded at noon on day \(t\).

\par
The values of the input variable, time, are displayed on the horizontal axis, and the values of the output variable, DJIA, are displayed on the vertical axis. There is no formula that gives the DJIA for a particular day; but it is still a function, defined by its graph. The value of \(f(t)\) is specified by the vertical coordinate of the point with the given t-coordinate.

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-119}{}The coordinates of point P tell us that \(f(15) = 2412\), so the DJIA was 2412 at noon on October 15.\item\hypertarget{li-120}{}We can say that \(f(20) = 1726\), so the point \((20, 1726)\) lies on the graph of \(f\). This point is labeled \(Q\) in \hyperref[fig-DJIA]{Figure~\ref{fig-DJIA}}.\end{enumerate}

Thus, the coordinates of each point on the graph of the function represent a pair of corresponding

Because the points \((−5, −2)\), \((−3, −2)\), and \((3, −2)\) lie on the graph, we know that \(g(−5) = −2\), \(g(−3) = −2\), and \(g(3) = −2\). Thus, the \(t\)-values we want are \(−5\), \(−3\), and \(3\).\item\hypertarget{li-129}{}The highest point on the graph is \((1, 4)\), so the largest \(y\)-value is \(4\). Thus, the maximum value of \(g(t)\) is \(4\), and it occurs when \(t = 1\).\item\hypertarget{li-130}{}A graph is increasing if the \(y\)-values get larger as we read from left to right. The graph of \(g\) is increasing for \(t\)-values between \(−4\) and \(1\), and between \(3\) and \(5\). Thus, \(g\) is increasing on the intervals \((−4, 1)\) and \((3, 5)\).\end{enumerate}

\subsection[The Vertical Line Test]{The Vertical Line Test}\label{subsection-15}
In a function, two different outputs cannot be related to the same input. This restriction means that two different ordered pairs cannot have the same first coordinate. What does it mean for the graph of the function?%
\par
Consider the graph shown in \hyperref[fig-vertical-line-test]{Figure~\ref{fig-vertical-line-test}}a. Every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, so there is only one point on the graph for each \(x\)-value. This graph represents a function. In \hyperref[fig-vertical-line-test]{Figure~\ref{fig-vertical-line-test}}b, however, the line \(x = 2\) intersects the graph at two points, \((2, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\). Two different \(y\)-values, \(1\) and \(4\), are related to the same \(x\)-value, \(2\). This graph cannot be the graph of a function.%

\noindent\textbf{\large The Vertical Line Test}\label{assemblage-8}\par\medskip
A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph in
at most one point.%

\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    Graph (a) represents a function, because it passes the vertical line test. Graph (b) is not the graph of a function, because the vertical line at (for example) \(x = 1\) intersects the graph at two points. For graph (c), notice the break in the curve at \(x = 2\): The solid dot at \((2, 1)\) is the only point on the graph with \(x = 2\); the open circle at \((2, 3)\) indicates that \((2, 3)\) is not a point on the graph. Thus, graph (c) is a function, with \(f(2) = 1\).

For example, the point \((2, 7)\) lies on the graph of \(y = 2x + 3\) shown in \hyperref[fig-function-graph]{Figure~\ref{fig-function-graph}} , so we know that the ordered pair \((2, 7)\) is a solution of the equation \(y = 2x + 3\). You can verify algebraically that \(x = \alert{2}\) and \(y = \alert{7}\) satisfy the equation: 
    \begin{equation*}\text{Does }~\alert{7} = 2 (\alert{2}) + 3\text{? Yes}\end{equation*}
    We can also say that \(x = 2\) is a solution of the one-variable equation \(2x + 3 = 7\). In fact, we can use the graph of \(y = 2x + 3\) to solve the equation \(2x + 3 = k\) for any value of \(k\). Thus, we can use graphs to find solutions to equations in one variable.%

Begin by locating the point \(P\) on the graph for which \(y = 150\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve}}. Now find the \(x\)-coordinate of point \(P\) by drawing an imaginary line from \(P\) straight down to the \(x\)-axis. The \(x\)-coordinate of \(P\) is \(x = 9\). Thus, \(P\) is the point \((9,150)\), and \(x = 9\) when \(y = 150\). The solution of the equation \(150 = 285 − 15x\) is \(x = 9\). You can verify the solution algebraically by substituting \(x = \alert{9}\) into the equation:%
\par
Does \(150 = 285 − 15(\alert{9})\)? %

In a similar fashion, we can solve inequalities with a graph. Consider again the graph of \(y = 2x + 3\), shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve3]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve3}}. We saw that \(x = 2\) is the solution of the equation \(2x + 3 = 7\). When we use \(x = 2\) as the input for the function \(f(x) = 2x + 3\), the output is \(y = 7\). Which input values for \(x\) produce output values greater than \(7\)? You can see in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve3]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve3}} that \(x\)-values greater than \(2\) produce \(y\)-values greater than \(7\), because points on the graph with \(x\)-values greater than \(2\) have \(y\)-values greater than \(7\). Thus, the solutions of the inequality \(2x + 3 \gt 7\) are \(x\gt 2\). You can verify this result by solving the inequality algebraically.}%

Use the graph of \(y = 285 − 15x\) to solve the inequality \begin{equation*}285 − 15x \gt 150\end{equation*}%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We begin by locating the point \(P\) on the graph for which \(y = 150\) and \(x = 9\) (its \(x\)-coordinate). Now, because \(y = 285 − 15x\) for points on the graph, the inequality \(285 − 15x \gt 150\) is equivalent to \(y \gt 150\). So we are looking for points on the graph with \(y\)-coordinate greater than \(150\). These points are shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve-inequality]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve-inequality}}. The \(x\)-coordinates of these points are the \(x\)-values that satisfy the inequality. From the graph, we see that the solutions are \(x \lt 9\).

We can also use this graphical technique to solve nonlinear equations and inequalities.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-graph-to-solve-cubic}
Use a graph of \(f(x) = −2x^3 + x^2 + 16x\) to solve the equation 
    \begin{equation*}−2x^3 + x^2 + 16x = 15\end{equation*}%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If we sketch in the horizontal line \(y = 15\), we can see that there are three points on the graph of \(f\) that have \(y\)-coordinate \(15\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-graph-to-solve-cubic]{Figure~\ref{fig-graph-to-solve-cubic}}. The \(x\)-coordinates of these points are the solutions of the equation %
\par
\begin{equation*}−2x^3 + x^2 + 16x = 15\end{equation*}
    From the graph, we see that the solutions are \(x = −3\), \(x = 1\), and approximately \(x = 2.5\). We can verify the solutions algebraically. For example, if \(x = \alert{−3}\), we have 
    \begin{align*}
        f(\alert{−3})\&−2(\alert{−3})3 + (\alert{−3})^2 + 16(\alert{−3})\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}

    and trace along the curve to the point \((2.4680851, 15.512401)\). We are close to a solution, because the \(y\)-value is close to \(15\). Try entering \(x\)-values close to \(2.4680851\), for instance, \(x = 2.4\) and \(x = 2.5\), to find a better approximation for the solution.

Which is more expensive, a 64-ounce bottle of Velvolux dish soap that costs \textdollar{}3.52, or a 60-ounce bottle of Rainfresh dish soap that costs \textdollar{}3.36?%
\par
You are probably familiar with the notion of comparison shopping. To decide which dish soap is the better buy, we compute the unit price, or price per ounce, for each bottle. The unit price for Velvolux is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{352 \text{ cents}}{64 \text{ ounces}}= 5.5 \text{ cents per ounce}\end{equation*}
and the unit price for Rainfresh is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{336 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ ounces}}= 5.6 \text{ cents per ounce}\end{equation*}
%
\par

    The Velvolux costs less per ounce, so it is the better buy. By computing the price of each brand for \emph{the same amount of soap}, it is easy to compare them.%
\par

    In many situations, a ratio, similar to a unit price, can provide a basis for comparison. \hyperref[example-rate-of-growth]{Example~\ref{example-rate-of-growth}} uses a ratio to measure a rate of growth.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-rate-of-growth}
Which grow faster, Hybrid A wheat seedlings, which grow 11.2 centimeters in 14 days, or Hybrid B seedlings, which grow 13.5 centimeters in 18 days?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
    We compute the growth rate for each strain of wheat. Growth rate is expressed as a ratio, \(\frac{\text{centimeters}}{\text{days}}\), or centimeters per day. The growth rate for Hybrid A is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{11.2 \text{ centimeters}}{14 \text{ days}}= 0.8 \text{ centimeters per day}\end{equation*}
and the growth rate for Hybrid B is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{13.5 \text{ centimeters}}{18 \text{ days}}= 0.75 \text{ centimeters per day}\end{equation*}
Because their rate of growth is larger, the Hybrid A seedlings grow faster.
\end{example}
\par

    By computing the growth of each strain of wheat seedling over the same unit of time, a single day, we have a basis for comparison. In this case, the ratio \(\frac{\text{centimeters}}{\text{day}}\) measures the rate of growth of the wheat seedlings.

\end{exercise}
\par

    In \hyperref[exercise-gas-mileage]{Exercise~\ref{exercise-gas-mileage}}, the ratio \(\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}\) measures the rate at which each car uses gasoline. By computing the mileage for each car for the same amount of gas, we have a basis for comparison. We can use this same idea, finding a common basis for comparison, to measure the steepness of an incline.

Which is steeper, Stony Point trail, which climbs 400 feet over a horizontal distance of 2500 feet, or Lone Pine trail, which climbs 360 feet over a horizontal distance of 1800 feet?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad For each trail, we compute the ratio of vertical gain to horizontal distance. For Stony Point trail, the ratio is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{400 \text{ feet}}{2500 \text{ feet}}= 0.16 \end{equation*}  
    and for Lone Pine trail, the ratio is
    \begin{equation*}\frac{360 \text{ feet}}{1800 \text{ feet}}= 0.20 \end{equation*} 
    Lone Pine trail is steeper, because it has a vertical gain of 0.20 foot for every foot traveled horizontally. Or, in more practical units, Lone Pine trail rises 20 feet for every 100 feet of horizontal distance, whereas Stony Point trail rises only 16 feet over a horizontal distance of 100 feet.%

    The slope of a line is a number. It tells us how much the \(y\)-coordinates of points on the line increase when we increase their \(x\)-coordinates by 1 unit. For instance, the slope \(\frac{3}{4}\) in \hyperref[example-slope-grid]{Example~\ref{example-slope-grid}} means that the \(y\)-coordinate increases by \(\frac{3}{4}\) unit when the \(x\)-coordinate increases by 1 unit. For increasing graphs, a larger slope indicates a greater increase in altitude, and hence a steeper line.

    The symbol \(\Delta\) (the Greek letter delta) is used in mathematics to denote \emph{change in}. In particular, \(\Delta y\) means \emph{change in \(y\)-coordinate}, and \(\Delta x\) means \emph{change in \(x\)-coordinate}. We also use the letter \(m\) to stand for slope.

        As we move from the point \(P(−4, 2)\) to the point \(Q(5, −1)\), we move \(3\) units \emph{down}, so \(\Delta y = −3\). We then move \(9\) units to the right, so \(\Delta x = 9\).

    We can move from point to point in either direction to compute the slope.

The slope is the same if we move from point \(Q\) to point \(P\) instead of from \(P\) to \(Q\). (See \hyperref[fig-negative-slope2]{Figure~\ref{fig-negative-slope2}}.) In that case, our computation looks like this:

    What does this value mean for the cost of renting a bicycle? The expression

    stands for
    \begin{equation*}\frac{\text{change in cost}}{\text{change in time}}= \frac{9 \text{ dollars }}{3 \text{ hours}}\end{equation*}
%

    If we increase the length of the rental by 3 hours, the cost of the rental increases by 9 dollars. The slope gives the rate of increase in the rental fee, 3 dollars per hour. In general, we can make the following statement.

    Depending on the variables involved, this rate might be interpreted as a rate of growth or a rate of speed. A negative slope might represent a rate of decrease or a rate of consumption. The slope of a graph can give us valuable information about the variables.

    We have defined the slope of a line to be the ratio \(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\) as we move from one point to another on the line. So far, we have computed \(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta x\) by counting squares on the graph, but this method is not always practical. All we really need are the coordinates of two points on the graph.
%
\par
We will use \terminology{subscripts} to distinguish the two points:%
\par
\(P_1\) means \emph{first point} and \(P_2\) means \emph{second point}.%
\par
We denote the coordinates of \(P_1\) by \((x_1, y_1)\) and the coordinates of \(P_2\) by \((x_2, y_2)\).

        Now consider a specific example. The line through the two points \(P_1 (2, 9)\) and \(P_2 (7,−6)\) is shown in \hyperref[fig-slope-formula]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-formula}}. We can find \(\Delta x\) by subtracting the \(x\)-coordinates of the points: 
        \begin{equation*}\Delta x = 7 − 2 = 5 \end{equation*}
        In general, we have 
        \begin{equation*}\Delta x = x_2 − x_1 \end{equation*}
        and similarly
        \begin{equation*}\Delta y = y_2 − y_1 \end{equation*}
    }%

\par

    These formulas work even if some of the coordinates are negative; in our example 
    \begin{equation*}\Delta y = y_2 − y_1 = −6 − 9 = −15\end{equation*}
    By counting squares \emph{down} from \(P_1\) to \(P_2\), we see that \(\Delta y\) is indeed \(−15\). The slope of the line in \hyperref[fig-slope-formula]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-formula}} is %

    As we saw in \hyperref[LinMod]{Section~\ref{LinMod}}, many linear models \(y = f (x)\) have equations of the form
    \begin{equation*}f (x) = (\text{starting value}) + (\text{rate of change}) \cdot x\end{equation*}
    The starting value, or the value of \(y\) at \(x = 0\), is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. Thus, we can write the equation of a line as
    \begin{equation*}f (x) = b + mx\end{equation*}
    where the constant term, \(b\), is the \(y\)-intercept of the line, and \(m\), the coefficient of \(x\), is the slope of the line. This form for the equation of a line is called the \terminology{slope-intercept form}.
%
\begin{mdframed}[style=assemblage]%

        If we write the equation of a linear function in the form,
        \begin{equation*}f (x) = b + mx\end{equation*}
        then \(m\) is the \terminology{slope} of the line, and \(b\) is the \terminology{\(y\)-intercept}.

    (You may have encountered the slope-intercept equation in the equivalent form

    We can see that the \(y\)-intercept of each line is given by the constant term, \(b\). By examining the table of values, we can also see why the coefficient of \(x\)gives the slope of the line: 
    For \(f (x)\), each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) decreases by \(3\) units. For \(g(x)\), each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) increases by \(2\) units. For each graph, the coefficient of \(x\) is a scale factor that tells us how many units \(y\) changes for \(1\) unit increase in \(x\). But that is exactly what the slope tells us about a line.

    In the equation \(f (x) = b + mx\), we call \(m\) and \(b\) \terminology{parameters}. Their values are fixed for any particular linear equation; for example, in the equation \(y = 2x + 3\), \(m = 2\) and \(b = 3\), and the variables are \(x\) and \(y\). By changing the values of \(m\) and \(b\), we can write the equation for any line except a vertical line (see \hyperref[fig-slope-vs-intercept]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-vs-intercept}}). The collection of all linear functions \(f (x) = b + mx\) is called a \terminology{two-parameter} family of functions.

    Look again at the lines in \hyperref[fig-slope-vs-intercept]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-vs-intercept}}: There is only one line that has a given slope and passes through a particular point. That is, the values of \(m\) and \(b\) determine the particular line. The value of \(b\) gives us a starting point, and the value of \(m\) tells us which direction to go to plot a second point. Thus, we can graph a line given in slope-intercept form without having to make a table of values.

        \begin{equation*}m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{4}{3}\end{equation*}
        so starting at \((0, −2)\), we move \(4\) units in the \(y\)-direction and \(3\) units in the \(x\)-direction, to arrive at the point \((3, 2)\). Finally, we draw the line through these two points. (See \hyperref[fig-slope-intercept]{\ref{fig-slope-intercept}}.)\end{enumerate}

point on the line as a check. If we use \(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \frac{−4}{−3}\), we move down \(4\) units and left \(3\) units from the \(y\)-intercept to find the point \((−3, −6)\) on the line.%

    We can find the equation for a line if we know its slope and \(y\)-intercept. What if we do not know the \(y\)-intercept, but instead know some other point on the line? There is only one line that passes through a given point and has a given slope. For example, we can graph the line of slope \(\frac{−3}{4}\) that passes through the point \((1, −4)\). }%
}% end body 
{}% caption 
\popValignCaptionBottom
\end{figure}
We first plot the given point, \((1, −4)\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-point-slope]{Figure~\ref{fig-point-slope}}. Then we use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is
        \begin{equation*}m =\frac{−3}{4}= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\end{equation*}
    so we move down \(3\) units and then \(4\) units to the right, starting from \((1, −4)\). This brings us to the point \((5, −7)\). We can then draw the line through these two points.%
\par
We can also find an equation for the line, as shown in Example 4.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-point-slope}
Find an equation for the line that passes through \((1, −4)\) and has slope \(\frac{−3}{4}\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We will use the formula for slope,
    \begin{equation*}m = \frac{y_2 − y_1}{x_2 − x_1}\end{equation*}
    We substitute \(\frac{−3}{4}\) for the slope, \(m\), and \((1, −4)\) for \((x_1, y_1)\). For the second point, \((x_2, y_2)\), we will use the variable point \((x, y)\). Substituting these values into the slope formula gives us
    \begin{equation*}\frac{−3}{4}= \frac{y − (−4)}{x − 1}=\frac{y + 4}{x − 1}\end{equation*}
    To solve for \(y\) we first multiply both sides by \(x − 1\).
    \begin{align*}
                \alert{(x-1)}\frac{−3}{4}\&
                =\frac{y +4}{x − 1}\alert{(x-1)} \&\&\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                \frac{−3}{4}(x-1)\&=y+4  \&\&\text{Apply the distributive law.}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                \frac{−3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}\&=y+4   \&\& 
                \text{Subtract 4 from both sides.}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}
                \frac{−3}{4}x-\frac{13}{4}\&=y \&\& \frac{3}{4}-4=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{16}{4}=\frac{-13}{4}
    \end{align*}
\end{example}
\par

    When we use the slope formula in this way to find the equation of a line, we substitute a variable point \((x, y)\) for the second point. This version of the formula, 
    \begin{equation*}m = \frac{y − y_1}{x − x_1}\end{equation*}
    is called the \terminology{point-slope form} for a linear equation. It is sometimes stated in another form obtained by clearing the fraction to get
    \begin{align*}
                \alert{(x−x_1)}m\&
                =\frac{y -y_1}{x − x_1}\alert{(x−x_1)} \&\&

Choosing an appropriate function for a model is a complicated process. In this section, we consider only linear models and explore methods for fitting a linear function to a collection of data points. First, we fit a line through two data points.

    If we already know that two variables are related by a linear function, we can find a formula from just two data points. For example, variables that increase or decrease at a constant rate can be described by linear functions.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-wine}
In 1993, Americans drank 188.6 million cases of wine. Wine consumption increased at a constant rate over the next decade, and we drank 258.3 million cases of wine in 2003. (Source: Los Angeles Times, Adams Beverage Group)%

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-183}{}We have two data points of the form \((t, W)\), namely \((3, 188.6)\) and \((13, 258.3)\). We use the point-slope formula to fit a line through these two points. First, we compute the slope.
        \begin{equation*}\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}=\frac {258.3 − 188.6}{13 − 3}= 6.97\end{equation*}
        Next, we use the slope m = \(6.97\) and either of the two data points in the point-slope formula.
        \begin{align*}
            W \amp =W_1 + m(t − t_1) \\
            W \amp = 188.6 + 6.97(t − 3) \\
            W \amp = 167.69 + 6.97t
        \end{align*}

        Thus, \(W = f (t) = 167.69 + 6.97t\).
        \item\hypertarget{li-184}{}The slope gives us the rate of change of the function, and the units of the variables can help us interpret the slope in context.
        \begin{equation*}\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}= 
            \frac{258.3 − 188.6 \text{millions of cases}}{13 − 3\text{ years}}
                = 6.97 millions of cases /year
        \end{equation*}
        Over the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, wine consumption in the United States increased at a rate of 6.97 million cases per year.\end{enumerate}

    The graph in \hyperref[example-gas-mileage]{Example~\ref{example-gas-mileage}} is called a \terminology{scatterplot}. The points on a scatterplot may or may not show some sort of pattern. Consider the three plots in \hyperref[fig-scatterplots]{Figure~\ref{fig-scatterplots}}. In \hyperref[fig-scatterplots]{Figure~\ref{fig-scatterplots}}a, the data points resemble a cloud of gnats; there is no apparent pattern to their locations. In \hyperref[fig-scatterplots]{Figure~\ref{fig-scatterplots}}b, the data follow a generally decreasing trend, but certainly do not all lie on the same line. The points in \hyperref[fig-scatterplots]{Figure~\ref{fig-scatterplots}}c are even more organized; they seem to lie very close to an imaginary line.

    If the data in a scatterplot are roughly linear, we can estimate the location of an imaginary \terminology{line of best} fit that passes as close as possible to the data points. We can then use this line to make predictions about the data.%

        One measure of a person's physical fitness is the \terminology{body mass index}, or BMI. Your BMI is the ratio of your weight in kilograms to the square of your height in centimeters. Thus, thinner people have lower BMI scores, and fatter people have higher scores. The Centers for Disease Control considers a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 to be healthy. The points on the scatterplot in \hyperref[fig-BMI]{Figure~\ref{fig-BMI}} show the BMI of Miss America from 1918 to 1998. From the data in the scatterplot, can we see a trend in Americans’ ideal of female beauty?

    Human brains consume a large amount of energy, about 16 times as much as muscle tissue per unit weight. In fact, brain metabolism accounts for about 25\% of an adult human’s energy needs, as compared to about 5\% for other mammals. As hominid species evolved, their brains required larger and larger amounts of energy, as shown in \hyperref[fig-hominid-brains]{Figure~\ref{fig-hominid-brains}}.

    The process of predicting an output value based on a straight line that fits the data is called \terminology{linear regression}, and the line itself is called the \terminology{regression line}. The equation of the regression line is usually used (instead of a graph) to predict values.%

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-205}{}We first calculate the slope by choosing two points on the regression line we drew in \hyperref[fig-BMI2]{Figure~\ref{fig-BMI2}}. The points we choose are not necessarily any of the original data points; instead they should be points on the regression line itself. The line appears to pass through the points \((17, 20)\) and \((67, 18)\). The slope of the line is then
        \begin{equation*}m = \frac{18 − 20}{67 − 17}\approx −0.04\end{equation*}
        Now we use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line. (If you need to review the point-slope formula, see \hyperref[linear-functions]{Section~\ref{linear-functions}}.) We substitute \(m = −0.04\) and use either of the two points for \((x_1, y_1)\); we will choose \((17, 20)\). The equation of the regression line is
        \begin{align*}
        y \amp = y_1 + m(x − x_1)\\
        y \amp = 20−0.04(x−17)
        \amp \amp \text{Simplify.}\\
        y \amp = 20.68 − 0.04t\\
        \end{align*}
        \item\hypertarget{li-206}{}We will use the regression equation to make our prediction. For Miss America 1980, \(t = 60\) and 
        \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(60) = 18.28\end{equation*}

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Linear Interpolation and Extrapolation]{Linear Interpolation and Extrapolation}\label{subsection-31}

        Using a regression line to estimate values between known data points is called \terminology{interpolation}. Making predictions beyond the range of known data is called \terminology{extrapolation}.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-BMI-extrapolation}
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-209}{}Use linear interpolation to estimate the BMI of Miss America 1960.\item\hypertarget{li-210}{}Use linear extrapolation to predict the BMI of Miss America 2001.\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-211}{}For 1960, we substitute \(t = 40\) into the regression equation we found in \hyperref[example-BMI-regression]{Example~\ref{example-BMI-regression}}. 
        \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(40) = 19.08\end{equation*} 
        We estimate that Miss America 1960 had a BMI of 19.08. (Her BMI was actually 18.79.)\item\hypertarget{li-212}{}For 2001, we substitute \(t = 81\) into the regression equation. 
        \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(81) = 17.44\end{equation*}\end{enumerate}
Our model predicts that Miss America 2001 had a BMI of 17.44. In fact, her BMI was 20.25. By the late 1990s, public concern over the self-image of young women had led to a reversal of the trend toward ever-thinner role models.%
\end{example}
\par

    \hyperref[example-BMI-extrapolation]{Example~\ref{example-BMI-extrapolation}}b illustrates an important fact about extrapolation: If we try to extrapolate too far, we may get unreasonable results. For example, if we use our model to predict the BMI of Miss America 2520 (when \(t = 600\)), we get 
    \begin{equation*}y = 20.68 − 0.04(600) =−3.32\end{equation*}
    Even if the Miss America pageant is still operating in 600 years, the winner cannot have a negative BMI. Our linear model provides a fair approximation for 1920–1990, but if we try to extrapolate too far beyond the known data, the model may no longer apply.

    We can also use interpolation and extrapolation to make estimates for nonlinear functions. Sometimes a variable relationship is not linear, but a portion of its graph can be approximated by a line. The graph in \hyperref[fig-Emily-height]{Figure~\ref{fig-Emily-height}} shows a child’s height each month. The graph is not linear because her rate of growth is not constant; her growth slows down as she approaches her adult height. However, over a short time interval the graph is close to a line, and that line can be used to approximate the coordinates of points on the curve.

    Estimating a line of best fit is a subjective process. Rather than base their estimates on such a line, statisticians often use the \terminology{least squares regression line}. This regression line minimizes the sum of the squares of all the vertical distances between the data points and the corresponding points on the line (see \hyperref[fig-least-squares]{Figure~\ref{fig-least-squares}}). Many calculators are programmed to find the least squares regression line, using an algorithm that depends only on the data, not on the appearance of the graph.
