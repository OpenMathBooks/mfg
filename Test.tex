\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
Mathematics, as we all know, is the language of science, and fluency in algebraic skills has always been necessary for anyone aspiring to disciplines based on calculus. But in the information age, increasingly sophisticated mathematical methods are used in all fields of knowledge, from archaeology to zoology. Consequently, there is a new focus on the courses before calculus. The availability of calculators and computers allows students to tackle complex problems involving real data, but requires more attention to analysis and interpretation of results. All students, not just those headed for science and engineering, should develop a mathematical viewpoint, including critical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and estimation, in addition to computational skills. \emph{Modeling, Functions and Graphs} employs a variety of applications to motivate mathematical thinking.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .1 MODELING}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[MODELING]{MODELING}\label{section-1}
The ability to model problems or phenomena by algebraic expressions and equations is the ultimate goal of any algebra course. Through a variety of applications, we motivate students to develop the skills and techniques of algebra. Each chapter includes an interactive Investigation that gives students an opportunity to explore an openended modeling problem. These Investigations can be used in class as guided explorations or as projects for small groups. They are designed to show students how the mathematical techniques they are learning can be applied to study and understand new situations.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .2 Functions}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[Functions]{Functions}\label{section-2}
The fundamental concept underlying calculus and related disciplines is the notion of function, and students should acquire a good understanding of functions before they embark on their study of college-level mathematics. While the formal study of functions is usually the content of precalculus, it is not too early to begin building an intuitive understanding of functional relationships in the preceding algebra courses. These ideas are useful not only in calculus but in practically any field students may pursue. We begin working with functions in Chapter 1 and explore the different families of functions in subsequent chapters.%
\par
In all our work with functions and modeling we employ the “Rule of Four,” that all
problems should be considered using algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal methods.
It is the connections between these approaches that we have endeavored to establish in this course. At this level it is crucial that students learn to write an algebraic expression from a verbal description, recognize trends in a table of data, and
extract and interpret information from the graph of a function.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Section .3 Graphs}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[Graphs]{Graphs}\label{section-3}
No tool for conveying information about a system is more powerful than a graph. Yet many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more
global view. By taking advantage of graphing calculators, we examine a large number of examples and study them in more detail than is possible when every graph is plotted by hand. We can consider more realistic models in which calculations by more traditional methods are difficult or impossible.%
\par
We have incorporated graphing calculators into the text wherever they can be used to enhance understanding. Calculator use is not simply an add-on, but in many ways shapes
the organization of the material. The text includes instructions for the TI-84 graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility. We have not attempted to use all the features of the calculator or to teach calculator use for its own sake, but in all cases have let the mathematics suggest how technology should be used.%

    \terminology{Linear programming} is an application of linear systems developed in the 1940s to solve complex optimization problems during wartime operations. Today, linear programming is used in scheduling and allocation of resources, in shipping and telecommunications networks, and in the selection of stocks and bonds for portfolios. In 1980, the computer scientist Laszlo Lovasz said, ``If one would take statistics about which mathematical problem is using up most of the computer time in the world, ... the answer would probably be linear programming.'' 
%
\par

	George Dantzig (1914–2005) invented the simplex method for solving linear programming problems in 1947. His first application of the method was to determine an adequate diet of least cost. This problem involved 9 equations in 77 unknowns and took 120 days to solve using the desk calculators available at the time. In this chapter, we use a graphing technique to solve problems in two unknowns. For example, the diet of the Columbian ground squirrel consists of two foods: grass and forb (a type of flowering weed). Small animals spend most of their time foraging for food, but they must also be alert for predators. Which foraging strategy favors survival: Should the squirrel try to satisfy its dietary requirements in minimum time, thus minimizing its exposure to predators and the elements, or should it try to maximize its intake of nutrients?

\end{figure}
\par

	Using linear programming, Gary Belovsky of Notre Dame University identified the optimal amounts of forb and grass for each foraging strategy. We can compare those solutions to the squirrel's actual diet to see which strategy the squirrel favors.

\begin{investigation}[Interpolating Polynomials]\label{investigation-1}

	In {$\langle\langle$chap6$\rangle\rangle$}, we learned to fit a quadratic function through three points on its graph. A polynomial whose graph passes through a given set of points is called an \terminology{interpolating polynomial}. Because polynomials are easy to evaluate and manipulate, they are often used to approximate more complicated functions and to describe the shapes of curves.
%
\par

	In this Investigation, we find interpolating polynomials of degrees \(1\), \(2\), and \(3\) to approximate the function \(f(x) = \frac{12}{x}\).
%
\par

					Graph the function \(f(x) = \frac{12}{x}\) in the window

\end{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-4}{}
			First we will find a linear polynomial \(P_1(x) = ax + b\) that matches \(f(x)\) at \(x = 1\) and \(x=6\). We must find constants \(a\) and \(b\) so that \(P_1(1) = f(1)\) and \(P_1(6) = f(6)\).
			\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-5}{}
					The two conditions above translate into equations about \(a\) and \(b\). The constants \(a\) and \(b\) must satisfy the system
					\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
					Solve the system and find the polynomial \(P_1(x)\).
				%
\item\hypertarget{li-6}{}
					Graph \(P_1(x)\) in the same window with \(f(x)\).
				%
\end{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-7}{}
			Next, we will find a quadratic polynomial \(P_2(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\) that matches \(f(x)\) at \(x = 1\), \(2.5\), and \(6\).
			\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-8}{}
					Write and solve a system of equations for the constants \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
				%
\item\hypertarget{li-9}{}
					Graph \(P_2(x)\) in the same window with \(f(x)\).
				%
\end{enumerate}

		%
\item\hypertarget{li-10}{}
			We can also find a cubic polynomial \(P_3(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\) that matches \(f(x)\) at \(x = 1\), \(3\), \(4\), and \(6\).
			\begin{enumerate}[label=*\alph**]
\item\hypertarget{li-11}{}
					Write a system of equations for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\). We will see how to solve such a system later in this chapter. For now, we will use the calculator's cubic regression feature.
				%
\item\hypertarget{li-12}{}
					Enter the coordinates of \(P_3(x)\) evaluated at \(x=1\), \(3\), \(4\), and \(6\) into \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) under the \emph{STAT EDIT} menu. Then, from the \emph{STAT CALC} menu, choose \emph{6: CubicReg} and press \lstinline?ENTER?.

\subsection[Solving Systems by Graphing]{Solving Systems by Graphing}\label{subsection-1}

	A biologist wants to know the average weights of two species of birds in a wildlife preserve. She sets up a feeder whose platform is actually a scale and mounts a camera to monitor the feeder. She waits until the feeder is occupied only by members of the two species she is studying, robins and thrushes. Then she takes a picture, which records the number of each species on the scale and the total weight registered.
%
\par

	From her two best pictures, she obtains the following information. The total weight of three thrushes and six robins is \(48\) ounces, and the total weight of five thrushes and two robins is \(32\) ounces. Using these data, the biologist estimates the average weight of a thrush and of a robin. She begins by assigning variables to the two unknown quantities:
	\begin{align*}

			\amp\text{Average weight of a thrush:} ~~t			
		\\

			\amp\text{Average weight of a robin:} ~~r			
		
\end{align*}
%
\par

	Because there are two variables, the biologist must write two equations about the weights of the birds. In each of the two photos,
	\begin{equation*}
		(\text{weight of thrushes}) + (\text{weight of robins}) = \text{total weight}
	\end{equation*}
	Thus,
	\begin{alignat*}{3}
3t \amp {}+{} \amp  6r  {}\amp={} \amp 48\\
5t \amp {}+{} \amp 2r  {}\amp={} \amp 32

	Recall that every point on the graph of an equation represents a solution to that equation. A solution to \emph{both} equations corresponds to a point on both graphs. Therefore, a solution to the system is a point where the two graphs intersect. From \hyperref[fig-2x2-linear-system]{Figure~\ref{fig-2x2-linear-system}}, it appears that the intersection point is \((4, 6)\), so we expect that the values \(t=\alert{4}\) and \(r=\blert{6}\) form the solution to the system. We can check by verifying that these values satisfy \emph{both} equations in the system.
	\begin{align*}

			3(\alert{4}) + 6(\blert{6})\amp\stackrel{?}{=}48 \amp\amp\text{True}
		\\

			5(\alert{4}) + 2(\blert{6})\amp\stackrel{?}{=}32 \amp\amp\text{True}
		
\end{align*}
	Both equations are true, so we conclude that the average weight of a thrush is \(4\) ounces, and the average weight of a robin is \(6\) ounces.
%
\par

	We can obtain graphs for the equations in a system quickly and easily using a calculator.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-GC-2x2-system}

		Use your calculator to solve the system by graphing.
		\begin{align*}

				y \amp = 1.7x + 0.4
			\\

				y \amp = 4.1x + 5.2
			
\end{align*}
	%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
		Set the graphing window to
		\begin{align*}

				\text{Xmin} \amp = -9.4 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 9.4
			\\

				\text{Ymin} \amp = -10 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 10
			
\end{align*}
		and enter the two equations We can see in \hyperref[fig-GC-2x2-system]{Figure~\ref{fig-GC-2x2-system}} that the two lines intersect in the third quadrant. Use the \lstinline?TRACE? key or the \emph{intersect} feature to find the coordinates of the intersection point. Check that the point \((−2,−3)\) lies on both graphs. The solution to the system is \(x = −2\), \(y=-3\).

\end{example}
\par

	The values we obtain from a calculator may be only approximations, so it is a good idea to check the solution algebraically. In \hyperref[example-GC-2x2-system]{Example~\ref{example-GC-2x2-system}}, we find that both equations are true when we substitute \(x = \alert{−2}\) and \(y=\blert{-3}\).
	\begin{align*}

			\blert{-3}\amp = 1.7(\alert{-2})+0.4\amp\amp\text{True}

	Because the \lstinline?TRACE? feature does not show every point on a graph, we may not find the exact solution to a system by tracing the graphs.
%

		We can graph this system in the standard window by solving each equation for \(y\). Enter

				Y_1\amp = (21.06 − 3X)/−2.8
			\\

				Y_2\amp  = (5.3 − 2X)/1.2

		and then press \lstinline?ZOOM? \(6\). (Do not forget the parentheses around the numerator of each expression.) Trace along the first line to find the intersection point. It appears to be at \(x=4.468051\), \(y =-2.734195\), as shown in \hyperref[fig-GC-2x2-system2]{Figure~\ref{fig-GC-2x2-system2}}a. However, if we press the up or down arrow to read the coordinates off the second line, we see that for the same \(x\)-coordinate we obtain a different \(y\)-coordinate, as in \hyperref[fig-GC-2x2-system2]{Figure~\ref{fig-GC-2x2-system2}}b. The different \(y\)-coordinates indicate that we have not found an intersection point, although we are close. However, the intersect feature can give us a better estimate, \(x = 4.36\), \(y = −2.85\).

\begin{example}[]\label{example-3}

		Rani kayaks downstream for \(45\) minutes and travels a distance of \(6000\) meters. On the return journey upstream, she covers only \(4800\) meters in \(45\) minutes. How fast is the current in the river, and how fast would Rani kayak in still water? (Give your answers in meters per minute.)
	%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
		\leavevmode%
\begin{description}
\item[Step 1: ]{}
				\begin{tabular}{ll}
Rani's speed in still water:%
&\(r\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
Speed of the current:%
&\(s\)
\end{tabular}

			%
\item[Step 2:]{}
				We must write two equations using the variables \(r\) and \(s\). First, organize the information into a table. When Rani travels downstream, the current in the river helps her, so her effective speed is \(r+s\). When she travels upstream she is fighting the current, so her speed is actually \(r-s\).
				\begin{tabular}{AlAcAcAcA}\hrulethin
%
&Rate%
&Time%
&Distance%
\tabularnewline\hrulethin
Downstream%
&\(r+s\)&\(45\)&\(6000\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
Upstream%
&\(r-s\)&\(45\)&\(4800\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}

				Using the formula \(\text{rate} \times \text{time} = \text{distance}\), we write one equation describing Rani's journey downstream, and a second equation for the journey upstream.
				\begin{align*}

						(r + s) \cdot 45 \amp = 6000
					\\

						(r − s) \cdot 45 \amp = 4800
					
\end{align*}
				Apply the distributive law to write each equation in standard form.
				\begin{align*}

						45r + 45s \amp = 6000 \amp\amp(1)
					\\

						45r − 45s \amp = 4800 \amp\amp(2)
					
\end{align*}
			%
\item[Step 3:]{}
				To solve the system, we eliminate the variable \(s\) by adding the two equations vertically.
				\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
\(45r\)&\(+\)&\(45s\)&\(=\)&\(-6000\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
\(+45r\)&\(-\)&\(45s\)&\(=\)&\(4800\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(90r\)&\(\)&\(\)&\(=\)&\(10,800\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

				We now have an equation in one variable only, which we can solve for \(r\).
				\begin{align*}

						90r \amp = 10,800\amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by 90.}
					\\

						r \amp = 120
					
\end{align*}
				To solve for \(s\) we substitute \(r = 120\) into any previous equation involving both \(r\) and \(s\). We will use Equation (1).
				\begin{align*}

						45(120) + 45s\amp = 6000 \amp\amp\text{Simplify the left side.}
					\\

						5400 + 45s \amp = 6000 \amp\amp\text{Subtract 5400 from both sides.}
					\\

						45s \amp = 600 \amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by 45; reduce.}
					\\

						s\amp = \frac{40}{3}
					
\end{align*}
			%
\item[Step 4: ]{}
				The speed of the current is \(\frac{40}{3}\), or \(13\frac{1}{3} \) meters per minute, and Rani's speed in still water is \(120\) meters per minute.

\end{description}

	Because two straight lines do not always intersect at a single point, a \(2\times 2\) system of linear equations does not always have a unique solution. In fact, there are three possibilities, as illustrated in \hyperref[fig-3-cases-2x2-systems]{Figure~\ref{fig-3-cases-2x2-systems}}.

	%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
		We use the calculator to graph both equations on the same axes, as shown in \hyperref[fig-GC-parallel-lines]{Figure~\ref{fig-GC-parallel-lines}}. First, rewrite the second equation in slope-intercept form by solving for \(y\).
		\begin{align*}

				2x + 2y \amp = 3\amp\amp\text{Substract } 2x \text{ from both sides.}
			\\

				2y \amp = −2x + 3\amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by 2.}
			\\

				y \amp = −x + 1.5

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth,]{images/fig-GC-parallel-lines.pdf}\caption{\label{fig-GC-parallel-lines}}
\end{figure}

		The lines do not intersect within the viewing window; they appear to be parallel. If we look again at the equations of the lines, we recognize that both have slope \(-1\) but different \(y\)-intercepts, so they are parallel. Since parallel lines never meet, there is no solution to the system.
	%
\end{example}
\par

	A system with no solutions, such as the system in \hyperref[example-inconsistent-system]{Example~\ref{example-inconsistent-system}}, is called \terminology{inconsistent}. A \(2\times 2\) system of linear equations is inconsistent when the two equations correspond to parallel lines. This situation occurs when the lines have the same slope but different \(y\)-intercepts.
%
\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-4}

		Without graphing, show that the following system is inconsistent:
		\begin{gather*}

				3y = \frac{3}{2}x − 1
			\\

				2x − 4y = 3
			
\end{gather*}
	%
\end{exercise}
\par

	A linear system with infinitely many solutions is called \terminology{dependent}. A \(2\times 2\) system is dependent when the two equations actually describe the same line. This situation occurs when the two lines have the same slope \emph{and} the same \(y\)-intercept.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-5}

		Solve the system
		\begin{gather*}

				x = \frac{2}{3}y + 3
			\\

				3x − 2y = 9
			
\end{gather*}
	%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
		We begin by putting each equation in slope-intercept form.
		\begin{align*}

				x \amp = \frac{2}{3}y + 3\amp\amp\text{Subtract 3.}				
			\\

				x -3\amp = \frac{2}{3}y \amp\amp\text{Multiply by }	\frac{3}{2}.							
			\\

				\frac{3}{2}x-\frac{9}{2}\amp = y
			
\end{align*}
		For the second equation,
		\begin{align*}

				3x − 2y \amp = 9  \amp\amp\text{Subtract }	3x.
			\\

				−2y \amp = −3x + 9  \amp\amp\text{Divide by } -2.
			\\

				y \amp = \frac{3}{2}x − \frac{9}{2}
			
\end{align*}
		The two equations are actually different forms of the same equation. Because they are equivalent, they share the same line as a graph, as shown in \hyperref[fig-coincident-lines]{Figure~\ref{fig-coincident-lines}}. Every point on the first line is also a point on the second line, so every solution to the first equation is also a solution of the second equation. Thus, the system has infinitely many solutions.

		This equation has no solutions. The system is inconsistent. (Notice that both lines have slope \(\frac{-2}{3}\), but they have different \(y\)-intercepts, so their graphs are parallel.)

				We now have a system of equations.

	Being unable to read exact coordinates from a graph is not always a disadvantage. In many situations, fractional values of the unknowns are not acceptable.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-8}

		The mathematics department has \(\$40,000\) to set up a new computer lab. The department will need one printer for every four terminals it purchases. If a printer costs \(\$560\) and a terminal costs \(\$1520\), how many of each should the department buy?
	%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
		\leavevmode%
\begin{description}
\item[Step 1:]{}
				\begin{tabular}{ll}
Number of printers:%
&\(p\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
Number of terminals%
&\(t\)
\end{tabular}

			%
\item[Step 2:]{}
				Since the math department needs four times as many terminals as printers,
				\begin{equation*}t=4p\end{equation*}
				The total cost of the printers will be \(560p\) dollars, and the total cost of the terminals will be \(1520t\) dollars, so we have
				\begin{equation*}560p + 1520t = 40,000\end{equation*}
			%
\item[Step 3:]{}
				Solve the second equation for \(t\) to get
				\begin{equation*}t=(40,000 - 560p)/1520\end{equation*}
				Now we graph the equations
				\begin{align*}

						Y_1 \amp =4X
					\\

						Y_2 \amp =(40000 − 560X)/1520
					
\end{align*}
				on the same set of axes. The second graph is not visible in the standard graphing window, but with a little experimentation we can find an appropriate window setting. The WINDOW values used for Figure 8.8 are
				\begin{align*}

						\text{Xmin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 9.4
					\\

						\text{Ymin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 30
					
\end{align*}
				The lines intersect at approximately \((6, 24)\). These values satisfy the first equation, but not the second.
				\begin{align*}

						560(\alert{6})+1520(\blert{24})\amp\stackrel{?}{=}40,000 
					\\

						39,840 \amp\ne 40,000
					
\end{align*}
			%
\item[Step 4:]{}
				The exact solution to the system is \(\left(\frac{500}{83},\frac{2000}{83}\right)\). But this solution is not of practical use, since the math department cannot purchase fractions of printers or terminals. The department can purchase \(6\) printers and \(24\) terminals (with some money left over).

	The owner of a retail business must try to balance the demand for his product from consumers with the supply he can obtain from manufacturers. Supply and demand both vary with the price of the product: Consumers usually buy fewer items if the price increases, but manufacturers will be willing to supply more units of the product if its price increases.
%
\par

	The \terminology{demand function} gives the number of units of the product that consumers will buy in terms of the price per unit. The \terminology{supply function} gives the number of units that the producer will supply in terms of the price per unit. The price at which the supply and demand are equal is called the \terminology{equilibrium price}. This is the price at which the consumer and the producer agree to do business.

\section[Systems of Linear Equations in Three Variables]{Systems of Linear Equations in Three Variables}\label{Systems-of-Linear-Equations-in-Three-Variables}

	Some problems involve three (or more) unknown quantities, and efficient techniques for solving linear systems in many variables are available. In this section, we solve systems of three linear equations in three variables.
%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.2.1 \(3\times 3\) Linear Systems}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[\(3\times 3\) Linear Systems]{\(3\times 3\) Linear Systems}\label{subsection-5}

	A solution to an equation in three variables, such as
	\begin{equation*}x + 2y − 3z = −4\end{equation*}
	is an ordered triple of numbers that satisfies the equation. For example, \((0, -2, 0)\) and \((-1, 0, 1)\) are solutions to the equation above, but \((1, 1, 1)\) is not. You can verify this by substituting the coordinates into the equation to see if a true statement results.
	\begin{alignat*}{5}

			\amp\text{For }(0,−2, 0):{}\amp 0   {}+{}\amp 2(−2) \amp{}−{}\amp 3(0) \amp = −4{}\amp\hphantom{blank} \text{True}\amp
		\\

			\amp\text{For }(−1, 0, 1):{}\amp {−}1 {}+{}\amp 2(0)  \amp{}−{}\amp 3(1) \amp = −4{}\amp\hphantom{blank} \text{True}\amp
		\\

			\amp\text{For }(1, 1, 1):{}\amp 1   {}+{}\amp 2(1)  \amp{}−{}\amp 3(1) \amp = −4{}\amp\hphantom{blank} \text{Not true}\amp 
		
\end{alignat*}
	As with the two-variable case, a single linear equation in three variables has infinitely many solutions.
%
\par

	An ordered triple \((x, y, z)\) can be represented geometrically as a point in space using a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (see \hyperref[fig-3D-point]{Figure~\ref{fig-3D-point}}). In this coordinate system, the graph of a linear equation in three variables is a plane, and the fact that there are infinitely many solutions to the equation tells us that that there are infinitely many points in the corresponding plane.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[,]{images/fig-3D-point.pdf}\caption{\label{fig-3D-point}}
\end{figure}
\par

	A solution to a \emph{system} of three linear equations in three variables is an ordered triple that satisfies each equation in the system. That triple represents a point that must lie on all three graphs. \hyperref[fig-8-cases-for-3-planes]{Figure~\ref{fig-8-cases-for-3-planes}} shows the different ways in which three planes may intersect in space.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[,]{images/fig-8-cases-for-3-planes.pdf}\caption{\label{fig-8-cases-for-3-planes}}
\end{figure}
\par

	In \hyperref[fig-8-cases-for-3-planes]{Figure~\ref{fig-8-cases-for-3-planes}}a, the three planes intersect in a single point, so the corresponding system of three equations has a unique solution. In \hyperref[fig-8-cases-for-3-planes]{Figures~\ref{fig-8-cases-for-3-planes}}b, c, and d, the intersection is either a line or an entire plane, so the corresponding system has infinitely many solutions. Such a system is called \terminology{dependent}. In \hyperref[fig-8-cases-for-3-planes]{Figures~\ref{fig-8-cases-for-3-planes}}e, f, g, and h, the three planes have no common intersection, so the corresponding system has no solution. In this case, the system is said to be \terminology{inconsistent}.
%
\par

	It is impractical to solve \(3\times 3\) systems by graphing. Even when technology for producing three-dimensional graphs is available, we cannot read coordinates on such graphs with any confidence. Thus, we will restrict our attention to algebraic methods of solving such systems.
%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.2.2 Back-Substitution}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Back-Substitution]{Back-Substitution}\label{subsection-6}

	When we review our algebraic methods for \(2\times 2\) systems—substitution and linear combinations—we find features common to both. In both methods, we obtain an equation in one variable. Once we have solved for that variable, we substitute the value into an earlier equation to find the other variable.
%
\par

	One strategy for solving a \(3\times 3\) system extends this idea to include a third variable and a third equation. The following special case illustrates the substitution part of the procedure.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-back-substitution}

		Solve the system
		\begin{alignat*}{3}
 x +{}  2y \amp {}+{} \amp 3z \amp {}={} \amp 2\\
          -2y  \amp {}-{} \amp  4z \amp {}={} \amp -2\\
        \amp {}{} \amp 3z \amp {}={} \amp -3
\end{alignat*}
	%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
		The third equation involves only the variable \(z\), so we solve that equation to find \(z = −1\). Then we substitute \(-1\) for \(z\) in the second equation and solve for \(y\).
		\begin{align*}

				−2y − 4(\alert{−1}) \amp = −2
			\\

				−2y + 4 \amp= −2
			\\

				−2y \amp = −6
			\\

				y\amp=3
			
\end{align*}
		Finally, we substitute \(-1\) for \(z\) and \(3\) for \(y\) into the first equation to find \(x\).
		\begin{align*}

				x + 2(\blert{3}) + 3(\alert{−1}) \amp= 2
			\\

				x + 6 − 3 \amp = 2
			\\

				x\amp=-1
			
\end{align*}
		The solution is the ordered triple \((-1, 3, -1)\). You should verify that this triple satisfies all three equations of the system.
	%
\end{example}
\par

	The technique used in \hyperref[example-back-substitution]{Example~\ref{example-back-substitution}} is called \terminology{back-substitution}. It works in the special case where one of the equations involves exactly one variable, and a second equation involves that same variable and just one other variable. A \(3\times 3\) linear system with these properties is said to be in \terminology{triangular form}. If we can transform a system into triangular form, we can use back-substitution to complete the solution.
%
\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-10}

		Use back-substitution to solve the system
		\begin{alignat*}{3}
 2x +{}  2y \amp {}+{} \amp z \amp {}={} \amp 10\\
          y  \amp {}-{} \amp  4z \amp {}={} \amp 9\\
        \amp {}{} \amp 3z \amp {}={} \amp -6

\end{exercise}

\typeout{Subsection 1.2.3 Gaussian Reduction}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Gaussian Reduction]{Gaussian Reduction}\label{subsection-7}

	We can use linear combinations to reduce a \(3\times 3\) system to triangular form and then use back-substitution to find the solutions. Our strategy will be to eliminate one of the variables from each of the three equations by considering them in pairs. This results in a \(2\times 2\) system that we can solve using elimination. As an example, consider the system
	\begin{alignat*}{4}
 x \amp {}+{} \amp 2y \amp {}-{} \amp 3z \amp {}={} \amp -4\amp\hphantom{blankblank} (1)\\
2x \amp {}-{} \amp  y \amp {}+{} \amp  z \amp {}={} \amp  3\amp\hphantom{blankblank} (2)\\
3x \amp {}+{} \amp 2y \amp {}+{} \amp  z \amp {}={} \amp 10\amp\hphantom{blankblank} (3)
\end{alignat*}
	\leavevmode%
\begin{description}
\item[Step 1: ]{}
			This system is already in standard form. We can choose any one of the three variables to eliminate first. For this example, we will eliminate \(x\).
		%
\item[Step 2:]{}
			Choose two of the equations, say (1) and (2), and use a linear combination: We multiply Equation (1) by \(-2\) and add the result to Equation (2) to produce Equation (4).
			\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrr}
\(-2x\)&\(-\)&\(4y\)&\(+\)&\(6z\)&\(=\)&\(8\)&\(\hphantom{blank}\)&\(-2\times (1)\)\tabularnewline[0pt]

\(\)&\(\)&\(-5y\)&\(+\)&\(7z\)&\(=\)&\(11\)&\(\)&\((4)\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

		%
\item[Step 3:]{}
			Now we have an equation involving only two variables. But we need two equations in two unknowns to find the solution. So we choose a different pair of equations, say (1) and (3), and eliminate \(x\) again. We multiply Equation (1) by \(-3\) and add the result to Equation (3) to obtain Equation (5).
			\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrr}
\(-3x\)&\(-\)&\(6y\)&\(+\)&\(9z\)&\(=\)&\(12\)&\(\hphantom{blank}\)&\(-3\times (1)\)\tabularnewline[0pt]

\(\)&\(\)&\(-4y\)&\(+\)&\(10z\)&\(=\)&\(22\)&\(\)&\((5)\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

		%
\item[Step 4: ]{}
			We now form a \(2\times 2\) system with our new Equations (4) and (5).
			\begin{alignat*}{2}

					−5y\amp + \amp 7z \amp = 11 \hphantom{blankblank} (4)
				\\

					−4y\amp + \amp 10z \amp = 22 \hphantom{blankblank} (5)
				
\end{alignat*}
			We eliminate either \(y\) or \(z\) to obtain an equation in a single variable. If we choose to eliminate \(y\), we add \(4\) times Equation (4) to \(-5\) times Equation (5) to obtain Equation (6).
			\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrr}
\(-20y\)&\(+\)&\(28z\)&\(=\)&\(44\)&\(\hphantom{blank}\)&\(4\times (4)\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
\(20y\)&\(-\)&\(50z\)&\(=\)&\(-110\)&\(\)&\(-5\times (5)\)\tabularnewline\crulethin{1-5}
\(\)&\(\)&\(-22z\)&\(=\)&\(-66\)&\(\)&\((6)\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

		%
\item[Step 5:]{}
			Now we can start solving for the variables. To keep things organized, we form a triangular system: Choose one of the original equations (in three variables), one of the equations from our \(2\times 2\) system, and our final equation in one variable. We choose Equations (1), (4), and (6).
		\begin{alignat*}{4}
 x \amp {}+{} \amp 2y \amp {}-{} \amp 3z \amp {}={} \amp -4\amp\hphantom{blankblank} (1)\\
\amp \amp−4y \amp+\amp 10z \amp = \amp 22 \amp\hphantom{blankblank} (5)	\\
\amp \amp     \amp\amp -22z \amp {}={} \amp -66\amp\hphantom{blankblank} (6)	
\end{alignat*}
		%
\par

			This new system is in triangular form, and it has the same solutions as the original system. We complete the solution by back-substitution. Solve Equation (6) to find \(z=3\). Substituting \(\alert{3}\) for \(z\) in Equation (4), we find
		\begin{align*}

		 		−5y + 7(\alert{3}) \amp = 11
		 	\\

		 		−5y + 21 \amp = 11
		 	\\

		 		−5y \amp = −10
		 	\\

		 		y \amp = 2
		 	
\end{align*}%
\par

		Finally, we substitute \(\alert{3}\) for \(z\) and \(\blert{2}\) for \(y\) into Equation (1) to find
		\begin{align*}

				x + 2(\blert{2}) − 3(\alert{3}) \amp = −4
			\\

				x + 4 − 9 \amp = −4
			\\

				x\amp =1
			
\end{align*}
		The solution to the system is the ordered triple \((1, 2, 3)\). You can verify that this triple satisfies all three of the original equations.

	The results in \hyperref[Systems-of-Linear-Equations-in-Two-Variables]{Section~\ref{Systems-of-Linear-Equations-in-Two-Variables}} for identifying dependent and inconsistent systems can be extended to \(3\times 3\) linear systems. If at any step in forming linear combinations we obtain an equation of the form
	\begin{equation*}
		0x + 0y + 0z = k, \hphantom{blank}(k\ne 0)

	then the system is inconsistent and has no solution. If we obtain an equation of the form
	\begin{equation*}
		0x + 0y + 0z = 0
	\end{equation*}
	then the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions.

\subsection[Applications]{Applications}\label{subsection-9}

	Here are some problems that can be modeled by a system of three linear equations. When writing such systems, we must be careful to find three independent equations describing the conditions of the problem.
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-14}

		One angle of a triangle measures 4° less than twice the second angle, and the third angle is 20° greater than the sum of the first two. Find the measure of each angle.
	%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
		\leavevmode%
\begin{description}
\item[Step 1: ]{}
				Represent the measure of each angle by a separate variable.
				\begin{align*}

						\amp\text{First angle: }\amp\amp x
					\\

						\amp\text{Second angle: }\amp\amp y
					\\

						\amp\text{Third angle:}\amp\amp z
					
\end{align*}
			%
\item[Step 2:]{}
				Write the conditions stated in the problem as three equations.
				\begin{gather*}
x = 2y − 4\\
z = x + y + 20\\
x + y + z = 180
\end{gather*}
				(The third equation states the fact that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°.)
			%
\item[Step 3:]{}
				We follow the steps for solving a \(3\times 3\) linear system.
				1. 		Write the three equations in standard form.
						\begin{alignat*}{5}

								x\amp {}-{}\amp 2y\amp {}{}\amp \amp =\amp -4\amp\hphantom{blank} \amp(1)
							\\

								x\amp {}+{}\amp y\amp {}-{}\amp z\amp =\amp -20\amp\hphantom{blank} \amp(2)
							\\

								x\amp {}+{}\amp y\amp {}+{}\amp z\amp =\amp 180\amp\hphantom{blank} \amp(3)
							
\end{alignat*}		
				%

				\par

					2-3. Since Equation (1) has no \(z\)-term, it will be most efficient to eliminate the variable \(z\) from Equations (2) and (3). Add these two equations.

				\par

					5. Form a triangular system using Equations (3), (1), and (5). Use back-substitution to complete the solution.
					\begin{alignat*}{4}

							x\amp {}+{}\amp y\amp {}+{}\amp z\amp =\amp 180\hphantom{blankblank} \amp(2)

						\\

							3x\amp\amp\amp\amp\amp = \amp156\hphantom{blankblank} \amp(5)
						
\end{alignat*}
					Divide both sides of Equation (5) by \(3\) to find \(x = 52\). Substitute \(52\) for \(x\) in Equation (1) and solve for \(y\) to find
					\begin{align*}

							\alert{52} − 2y \amp = −4
						\\

							y \amp= 28
						
\end{align*}
					Substitute \(52\) for \(x\) and \(28\) for \(y\) in Equation (3) to find
					\begin{align*}

							\alert{52} + \blert{28} + z \amp= 180

							z\amp=100

\item[Step 4:]{}
				The angles measure 52°, 28°, and 100°.

\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-14}

		A manufacturer of office supplies makes three types of file cabinet: two-drawer, four-drawer, and horizontal. The manufacturing process is divided into three phases: assembly, painting, and finishing. A two-drawer cabinet requires 3 hours to assemble, 1 hour to paint, and 1 hour to finish. The four-drawer model takes 5 hours to assemble, 90 minutes to paint, and 2 hours to finish. The horizontal cabinet takes 4 hours to assemble, 1 hour to paint, and 3 hours to finish. The manufacturer employs enough workers for 500 hours of assembly time, 150 hours of painting, and 230 hours of finishing per week. How many of each type of file cabinet should he make in order to use all the hours available?

				Write three equations describing the time constraints in each of the three manufacturing phases. For example, the assembly phase requires \(3x\) hours for the two-drawer cabinets, \(5y\) hours for the four-drawer cabinets, and \(4z\) hours for the horizontal cabinets, and the sum of these times should be the time available, \(500\) hours.

\item[Step 3:]{}
				Solve the system. Follow the steps suggested below.
				\begin{enumerate}[label=*\arabic**]
\item\hypertarget{li-83}{}
						Clear the fractions from the second equation.
					%
\item\hypertarget{li-84}{}
						Subtract Equation (1) from \(3\) times Equation (3) to obtain a new Equation (4).
					%
\item\hypertarget{li-85}{}
						Subtract Equation (2) from twice Equation (3) to obtain a new Equation (5).
					%
\item\hypertarget{li-86}{}
						Equations (4) and (5) form a \(2\times 2\) system in \(y\) and \(z\). Subtract Equation (5) from Equation (4) to obtain a new Equation (6).
					%
\item\hypertarget{li-87}{}
						Form a triangular system with Equations (3), (4), and (6). Use back-substitution to complete the solution.
					%
\end{enumerate}

			%
\item[Step 4:]{}
				You should have found the following solution: The manufacturer should make \(60\) two-drawer cabinets, \(40\) four-drawer cabinets, and \(30\) horizontal cabinets.
