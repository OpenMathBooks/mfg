    <appendix>
        <title>Algebra Skills Refresher</title>
        <section xml:id="Order-of-Operations"><title>Order of Operations</title>

        <p>Numerical calculations often involve more than one operation. So that everyone agrees on how such expressions should be evaluated, we follow the order of operations.</p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="appendix-Linear-Equations-and-Inequalities"><title>Linear Equations and Inequalities</title>
        <p>An <term>equation</term> is just a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal. Equations relating two variables are particularly useful. If we know the value of one of the variables, we can find the corresponding value of the other variable by solving the equation.</p>
        </section>


        <section xml:id="appendix-Algebraic-Expressions-and-Problem-Solving"><title>Algebraic Expressions and Problem Solving</title>
        <p>You are familiar with the use of letters, or <term>variables</term>, to stand for unknown numbers in equations or formulas. Variables are also used to represent numerical quantities that change over time or in different situations. For example, <m>p</m> might stand for the atmospheric pressure at different heights above the Earth's surface. Or <m>N</m> might represent the number of people infected with cholera <m>t</m> days after the start of an epidemic.</p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="appendix-Graphs-and-Equations"><title>Graphs and Equations</title>
        <p>Graphs are useful tools for studying mathematical relationships. A graph provides an overview of a quantity of data, and it helps us identify trends or unexpected occurrences. Interpreting the graph can help us answer questions about the data.</p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="appendix-Linear-Systems-in-Two-Variables"><title>Linear Systems in Two Variables</title><index>linear system</index>
        <p>A <m>2\times 2</m> <term>system</term> of equations is a set of <m>2</m> equations in the same <m>2</m> variables. A <term index="yes">solution</term> of a <m>2\times 2</m> system is an ordered pair that makes each equation in the system true. In this section, we review two algebraic methods for solving <m>2\times 2</m> linear systems: substitution and elimination.</p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="appendix-Laws-of-Exponents"><title>Laws of Exponents</title><index>laws of exponents</index>
        <p>In this section, we review the rules for performing operations on powers.</p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="appendix-Polynomials-and-Factoring"><title>Polynomials and Factoring</title>
        <p>In <xref ref="appendix-Laws-of-Exponents" autoname="yes"/>, we used the first law of exponents to multiply two or more monomials. In this section, we review techniques for multiplying and factoring polynomials of several terms.</p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="appendix-Factoring-Quadratic-Trinomials"><title>Factoring Quadratic Trinomials</title>
        <p>Consider the trinomial
            <me>
                x^2 + 10x + 16
            </me>
        </p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="appendix-Working-with-Algebraic-Fractions"><title>Working with Algebraic Fractions</title>
        <p>
            A quotient of two polynomials is called a <term index="yes">rational expression</term> or an <term index="yes">algebraic fraction</term>. Operations on algebraic fractions follow the same rules as operations on common fractions.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="appendix-Working-with-Radicals"><title>Working with Radicals</title>
        <p>In some situations, radical notation is more convenient to use than exponents. In these cases, we usually simplify radical expressions algebraically as much as possible before using a calculator to obtain decimal approximations.</p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="appendix-Facts-from-Geometry"><title>Facts from Geometry</title>
        <p>
            In this section, we review some information you will need from geometry. You are already familiar with the formulas for the area and perimeter of common geometric figures; you can find these formulas in the reference section at the front of the book.

        <subsection><title>Subsets of the Real Numbers</title>
        <p>
            The numbers associated with points on a number line are called the <term index="yes">real numbers</term>. The set of real numbers is denoted by <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. You are already familiar with several types, or subsets, of real numbers:

    <appendix>
        <title>Using a Graphing Calculator</title>
        <introduction><p>This appendix provides instructions for TI-84 or TI-83 calculators from Texas Instruments, but most other calculators work similarly.We describe only the basic operations and features of the graphing calculator used in your textbook.</p></introduction>

        <subsection><title>On and Off</title>
        <p>
            Press <c>ON</c> to turn <em>on</em> the calculator (see Figure B.1a). You will see a cursor blinking in the upper left corner of the Home screen. Press <c>2nd</c><c>ON</c> to turn <em>off</em> the calculator.
