<subsection xml:id="Order-of-Operations"><title>Order of Operations</title>

<p>Numerical calculations often involve more than one operation. So that everyone agrees on how such expressions should be evaluated, we follow the order of operations.</p>

<assemblage><title>Order of Operations</title>
<p>
    <ol label="*1*">
        <li><p>
            Simplify any expressions within grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, square root bars, or fraction bars). Start with the innermost grouping symbols and work outward.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Evaluate all powers and roots.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Perform multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Perform additions and subtractions in order from left to right.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
</p>
</assemblage>
</subsection>




<subsection><title>Parentheses and Fraction Bars</title>
<p>
    We can use parentheses to override the multiplication-first rule. Compare the two expressions below.
    <md>
        <mrow>\amp\text{The sum of 4 times 6 and 10} \amp\amp 4 \cdot 6 + 10</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\text{4 times the sum of 6 and 10} \amp\amp  4(6 + 10)</mrow>
    </md>
</p>
<p>
    In the first expression, we perform the multiplication <m>4\times 6</m> first, but in the second expression we perform the addition <m>6 + 10</m> first, because it is enclosed in parentheses.
</p>
<p>
    The location (or absence) of parentheses can drastically alter the meaning of an expression. In the following example, note how the location of the parentheses changes the value of the expression.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-parentheses">
    <p>
        <ol label="*a*">
            <li><p><m>
                \begin{aligned}5-3\cdot 4^2 \amp = 5-3\cdot 16\\
                \amp = 5-48=-43
                \end{aligned}                
            </m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>
                \begin{aligned}5-(3\cdot 4)^2 \amp = 5-12^2\\
                \amp= 5-144 = -139
                 \end{aligned}
           </m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>
                \begin{aligned}(5-3\cdot 4)^2 \amp = (5-12)^2\\
                \amp = (-7)^2 = 49
                \end{aligned}
            </m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>
                \begin{aligned}(5-3)\cdot 4^2 \amp = 2\cdot 16\\
                \amp = 32
                \end{aligned}
            </m></p></li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</example>

<warning>
    <p>
        In the expression <m>5 − 12^2</m>, which appears in <xref ref="example-parentheses" autoname="yes"/>, the exponent <m>2</m> applies only to <m>12</m>, not to <m>-12</m>. Thus, <m>5 − 12^2 \ne 5 + 144</m>.
    </p>
</warning>

<p>
    The order of operations mentions other grouping devices besides parentheses: fraction bars and square root bars. Notice how the placement of the fraction bar affects the expressions in the next example.
</p>

    <p>
        <ol label="*a*">

                \begin{aligned}
                \frac{1+2}{3\cdot 4} \amp = \frac{3}{12}\\
                \amp = \frac{1}{4}
                \end{aligned}
            </m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>
                \begin{aligned}
                1+\frac{2}{3\cdot 4} \amp = 1+ \frac{2}{12}\\
                \amp = 1+\frac{1}{6}=\frac{7}{6}
                \end{aligned}

                \begin{aligned}
                \frac{1+2}{3}\cdot 4 \amp = \frac{3}{3}\cdot 4\\
                \amp = 1\cdot 4=4
                \end{aligned}

<subsection><title>Radicals</title>
<p>
    You are already familiar with square roots. Every nonnegative number has two square roots, defined as follows:
    <me>s ~~\text{ is a square root of }~~ n ~~\text{ if }~~s^2 = n</me>
    There are several other kinds of roots, one of which is called the <term index="yes" >cube root</term>, denoted by <m>\sqrt[3]{n}</m>. We define the cube root as follows.
</p>
<assemblage><title>Cube Roots</title><index>cube root</index>
<p>
    <me>b ~~\text{ is a cube root of }~~~ n ~~~\text{ if }~~~ b ~\text{ cubed equals }~~n.</me>
    In symbols, we write
    <me>b=\sqrt[3]{n} ~~\text{ if } ~~ b^3=n</me>
</p></assemblage>

<p>
    Although we cannot take the square root of a <em>negative number</em>, we can take the <em>cube root</em> of <em>any</em> real number. For example,
    <me>\sqrt[3]{64}=4 ~~\text{ because }~~ 4^3=64</me>
    and
    <me>\sqrt[3]{-27}=-3 ~~\text{ because }~~ (-3)^3=-27</me>
</p>
<p>
    In the order of operations, simplifying radicals and powers comes after parentheses but before products and quotients.
</p>

<example>
    <p>
        Simplify each expression.
        <ol label="*a*">
            <li><m>3\sqrt[3]{-8}</m></li>

            <li><m>\displaystyle{\frac{6-\sqrt[3]{-27}}{2}}</m></li>
        </ol>
    </p>
<solution>
    <p>
        <ol label="*a*">
            <li><m>3\sqrt[3]{-8}=3(-2)=-6</m></li>
            <li><m>2-\sqrt[3]{-125}=2-(-5)=7</m></li>
            <li><m>\displaystyle{\frac{6-\sqrt[3]{-27}}{2}=\frac{6-(-3)}{2}=\frac{9}{2}}</m></li>
        </ol>

<subsection><title>Scientific Notation</title>
<p>
    Scientists and engineers regularly encounter very large numbers such as
    <me>5,980,000,000,000,000,000,000,000</me>
    (the mass of the Earth in kilograms) and very small numbers such as
    <me>0.000 \,000 \,000 \,000 \,000 \,000 \,000 \,001 \,67</me>
    (the mass of a hydrogen atom in grams). These numbers can be written in a more compact and useful form by using powers of <m>10</m>.
</p>
<p>
    In our base <m>10</m> number system, multiplying a number by a positive power of <m>10</m> has the effect of moving the decimal place <m>k</m> places to the right, where <m>k</m> is the exponent in the power of <m>10</m>. For example,
    <me>3.529 \times 10^2 = 352.9 ~~~\text{ and }~~~ 25 \times 104 = 250,000</me>
    Multiplying by a power of <m>10</m> with a negative exponent moves the decimal place to the left. For example,
    <me>1728 \times 10^{−3} = 1.728 ~~~\text{ and }~~~ 4.6 \times 10^{−5} = 0.000046</me>
</p>
<p>
    Using this property, we can write any number as the product of a number between <m>1</m> and <m>10</m> (including <m>1</m>) and a power of <m>10</m>. For example, the mass of the Earth and the mass of a hydrogen atom can be expressed as
    <me>5.98 \times 1024 \text{ kilograms}\hphantom{blank} \text{ and }\hphantom{blank}1.67 \times 10^{−24} \text{ gram}</me>
    respectively. A number written in this form is said to be expressed in <term index="yes" >scientific notation</term>.

<example>
    <p>
        The average American eats <m>110</m> kilograms of meat per year. It takes about <m>16</m> kilograms of grain to produce <m>1</m> kilogram of meat, and advanced farming techniques can produce about <m>6000</m> kilograms of grain on each hectare of arable land. (The hectare is <m>10,000</m> square meters, or just under <m>2 1⁄2</m> acres.) Now, the total land area of the Earth is about <m>13</m> billion hectares, but only about <m>11\%</m> of that land is arable. Is it possible for each of the <m>5.5</m> billion people on Earth to eat as much meat as Americans do?
    </p>
<solution>
    <p>
        First we will compute the amount of meat necessary to feed every person on Earth <m>110</m> kilograms per year. There are <m>5.5 \times 10^9</m> people on Earth.
        <me>(5.5\times 10^9 \text{ people})\times (110 \text{ kg/person}) = 6.05\times 10^{11} \text{ kg of meat}</me>
        Next we will compute the amount of grain needed to produce that much meat.
        <me>
            (16 \text{ kg of grain/kg of meat})\times (6.05\times 10^{11} \text{ kg of meat}) = 9.68\times 10^{12} \text{ kg of grain}
        </me>
        Next we will see how many hectares of land are needed to produce that much grain.
        <me>
            (9.68\times 10^{12} \text{ kg of grain})\div(6000 \text{ kg/hectare}) = 1.613\times 10^9 \text{ hectares}
        </me>
        Finally, we will compute the amount of arable land available for grain production.
        <me>0.11\times (13\times 10^9 \text{ hectares}) = 1.43\times 10^9 \text{ hectares}</me>
        Thus, even if we use every hectare of arable land to produce grain for livestock, we will not have enough to provide every person on Earth with <m>110</m> kilograms of meat per year.

<section xml:id="appendix-Linear-Equations-and-Inequalities"><title>Linear Equations and Inequalities</title>
<p>An <term>equation</term> is just a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal. Equations relating two variables are particularly useful. If we know the value of one of the variables, we can find the corresponding value of the other variable by solving the equation.</p>

<example>
    <p>
        The equation <m>w = 6h</m> gives Loren's wages, <m>w</m>, in terms of the number of hours she works, <m>h</m>. How many hours does Loren need to work next week if she wants to earn <m>\$225</m>?
    </p>
<solution>
    <p>
        We know that <m>w = 225</m>, and we would like to know the value of <m>h</m>. We substitute the value for <m>w</m> into our equation and then solve for <m>h</m>.
        <md>
            <mrow>w \amp= 6h\amp\amp \text{Substitute 225 for }w.</mrow>
            <mrow>\alert{225} \amp= 6h\amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by } 6.</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{225}{\alert{6}}\amp = \frac{6h}{\alert{6}}\amp\amp \text{Simplify.}</mrow>
            <mrow>375.5\amp = h</mrow>
        </md>
        Loren must work <m>37.5</m> hours in order to earn <m>\$225</m>. In reality, Loren will probably have to work for <m>38</m> hours, because most employers do not pay for portions of an hour's work. Thus, Loren needs to work for <m>38</m> hours.
    </p>
</solution></example>

<p>
    To solve an equation we can generate simpler equations that have the same solutions. Equations that have identical solutions are called <term index="yes">equivalent equations</term>. For example,
    <me>3x − 5 = x + 3</me>
    and
    <me>2x = 8</me>
    are equivalent equations because the solution of each equation is <m>4</m>. Often we can find simpler equivalent equations by undoing in reverse order the operations performed on the variable.
</p>

<subsection><title>Solving Linear Equations</title>
<p>
    <term>Linear</term>, or first-degree, equations can be written so that every term is either a constant or a constant times the variable. The equations above are examples of linear equations. Recall the following rules for solving linear equations.
</p>

<assemblage><title>To Generate Equivalent Equations</title>
<p>
    <ol label="*1*">
        <li><p>
            We can add or subtract the <em>same</em> number on <em>both</em> sides of an equation.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            We can multiply or divide <m>both</m> sides of an equation by the <m>same</m> number (except zero).
        </p></li>
    </ol>
</p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    Applying either of these rules produces a new equation equivalent to the old one and thus preserves the solution.We use the rules to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
</p>

<example><p>
    Solve the equation <m>3x − 5 = x + 3</m>.
</p>
<solution>
    <p>
        We first collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation, and the constant terms on the other side.

                2x − 5 \alert{{}+ 5} \amp = 5 \alert{{}+ 5}\amp\amp \text{Add 5 to both sides.}

            </mrow>
            <mrow>
                \frac{2x}{\alert{2}}\amp =\frac{8}{\alert{2}}\amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by 2.}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>x\amp = 4\amp\amp\text{Simplify.}</mrow>
        </md>
        The solution is <m>4</m>. (You can check the solution by substituting <m>4</m> into the original equation to show that a true statement results.)

<p>
    A <term index="yes" >formula</term> is an equation that relates several variables. For example, the equation 
    <me>P = 2l + 2w</me>
    gives the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of its length and width.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose we have some wire fence to enclose an exercise area for rabbits, and we would like to see what dimensions are possible for different rectangles with that perimeter. In this case, it would be more useful to have a formula for the length of the rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width. We can find such a formula by solving the perimeter formula for <m>l</m> in terms of <m>P</m> and <m>w</m>.
    <md>
        <mrow>2l + 2w \amp= P \amp\amp\text{Subtact }2 w \text{ from both sides.}</mrow>
        <mrow>2l \amp= P − 2w \amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by 2.}</mrow>
        <mrow>l \amp= \frac{P − 2w}{2}</mrow>
    </md>
        The result is a new formula that gives the length of a rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width.
</p>

<example>
<p>
    The formula <m>5F = 9C + 160</m> relates the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, <m>F</m>, to the temperature in degrees Celsius, <m>C</m>. Solve the formula for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m>.
</p>
<solution>
    <p>
        We begin by isolating the term that contains <m>C</m>.

            <mrow>
                5F \amp= 9C + 160 \amp\amp\text{Subtract 160 from both sides.}

            <mrow>
                5F − 160 \amp = 9C \amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by 9.}

                \frac{5F − 160}{9} \amp =C
            </mrow>
        </md>
        We can also write the formula for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m> as <m>C = \frac{5}{9}F − \frac{160}{9}</m>.

<subsection><title>Linear Inequalities</title>
<p>
    The symbol <m>\gt</m> is called an <term index="yes">inequality symbol</term>, and the statement <m>a\gt b</m> is called an <term index="yes" >inequality</term>. There are four inequality symbols:
    <md>
        <mrow>\amp\gt \amp\amp\text{is greater than}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\lt \amp\amp\text{is less than}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\ge \amp\amp\text{is greater than or equal to}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\le \amp\amp\text{is less than or equal to}</mrow>
    </md>
</p>
<p>
    Inequalities that include the symbols <m>\gt</m> or <m>\le</m> are called <term index="yes">strict inequalities</term>; those that include <m>\ge</m> or <m>\le</m> are called <term index="yes">nonstrict</term>.
</p>
<p>
    If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality must be reversed. For example, if we multiply both sides of the inequality
    <me>2\lt 5</me>
    by <m>−3</m>, we get
    <md>
        <mrow>\alert{−3}(2) \amp\gt \alert{−3}(5)\amp\amp \text{Change inequality symbol from }\lt \text{ to }\gt.</mrow>
        <mrow>−6 \amp\gt −15.</mrow>
    </md>
    Because of this property, the rules for solving linear equations must be revised slightly for solving linear inequalities.

            We may add or subtract the same number to both sides of an inequality without changing its solutions.

        <li><p>
            We may multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a <em>positive</em> number without changing its solutions.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a <em>negative</em> number, we must <em>reverse the direction of the inequality symbol</em>.

</assemblage>

<example>
    <p>
        Solve the inequality <m>4 − 3x \ge −17</m>.

        Use the rules above to isolate <m>x</m> on one side of the inequality.

            <mrow>x \amp\le 7</mrow>
        </md>
        Notice that we reversed the direction of the inequality when we divided by <m>-3</m>. Any number less than or equal to <m>7</m> is a solution of the inequality.

<subsection><title>Interval Notation</title>
<p>
    The solutions of the inequality in <xref ref="example-compound-inequality" autoname="yes"/> form an interval. An <term index="yes" >interval</term> is a set that consists of all the real numbers between two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
</p>
<p>
    The set <m>−2 \le x \le 2</m> includes its endpoints <m>-2</m> and <m>2</m>, so we call it a <term index="yes" >closed interval</term>, and we denote it by <m>[−2, 2]</m> (see <xref ref="fig-numline-closed-vs-open" autoname="yes"/>a). The square brackets tell us that the endpoints are included in the interval. An interval that does not include its endpoints, such as <m>−2 \lt x \lt 2</m>, is called an <term index="yes" >open interval</term>, and we denote it with round brackets, <m>(−2, 2)</m> (see <xref ref="fig-numline-closed-vs-open" autoname="yes"/>b).
    <figure xml:id="fig-numline-closed-vs-open"><image source="images/fig-numline-closed-vs-open" alt="closed interval and open interva"/><caption>       
    </caption> </figure>
</p>

<warning>
    <p>
        Do not confuse the open interval <m>(−2, 2)</m> with the point <m>(−2, 2)</m>! The notation is the same, so you must decide from the context whether an interval or a point is being discussed.
    </p>
</warning>

<p>
    We can also discuss <term index="yes">infinite intervals</term>, such as <m>x\lt 3</m> and <m>x\ge -1</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-numline-infinite-intervals" autoname="yes"/>. We denote the interval <m>x\lt 3</m> by <m>(−\infty, 3)</m>, and the interval <m>x\ge -1</m> by <m>[−1, \infty)</m>. The symbol <m>\infty</m>, for infinity, does not represent a specific real number; it indicates that the interval continues forever along the real line.
   <figure xml:id="fig-numline-infinite-intervals"><image source="images/fig-numline-infinite-intervals" alt="infinite intervals"/><caption></caption> </figure> 
</p>
<p>
    Finally, we can combine two or more intervals into a larger set. For example, the set consisting of <m>x\lt -1</m> or <m>x\gt 2</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-numline-disjoint-infinite-intervals" autoname="yes"/>, is the <term index="yes">union</term> of two intervals and is denoted by <m>(−\infty,−2) \cup (2,\infty)</m>.
    <figure xml:id="fig-numline-disjoint-infinite-intervals"><image source="images/fig-numline-disjoint-infinite-intervals" alt="number line with two disjoint infinite intervals"/><caption></caption> </figure>
</p>
<p>
    Many solutions of inequalities are intervals or unions of intervals.

<section xml:id="appendix-Algebraic-Expressions-and-Problem-Solving"><title>Algebraic Expressions and Problem Solving</title>
<p>You are familiar with the use of letters, or <term>variables</term>, to stand for unknown numbers in equations or formulas. Variables are also used to represent numerical quantities that change over time or in different situations. For example, <m>p</m> might stand for the atmospheric pressure at different heights above the Earth's surface. Or <m>N</m> might represent the number of people infected with cholera <m>t</m> days after the start of an epidemic.</p>
<p>
    An <term index="yes">algebraic expression</term> is any meaningful combination of numbers, variables, and symbols of operation. Algebraic expressions are used to express relationships between variable quantities.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-Loren">
    <p>
        Loren makes <m>\$6</m> an hour working at the campus bookstore.

            <li><p>
                Write an algebraic expression for the amount of Loren's weekly earnings.

            <li><p>
                The amount Loren earns is given by
                <me>6\times (\text{number of hours Loren worked})</me>

    </p>
</solution></example>

<p>
    The algebraic expression <m>6h</m> represents the amount of money Loren earns <em>in terms of</em> the number of hours she works. If we substitute a specific value for the variable in an expression, we find a numerical value for the expression. This is called <term index="yes">evaluating</term> the expression.

<p>
    On a calculator, we enter the expression for <m>C</m> in the order it appears, including the parentheses. (Experiment to see whether your calculator requires you to enter the <c>×</c> symbol after 2.80.) The keying sequence
    <me>2.80 \times ( 8.3 + 2.9 ) \boxed{\text{ENTER}}</me>
    gives the correct result, <m>31.36</m>.
</p>
</remark>

<warning>
    <p>
        If we omit the parentheses, the calculator will perform the multiplication before the addition. Thus, the keying sequence
        <me>2.80 \times 8.3 + 2.9</me>
        gives an incorrect result for <xref ref="example-parcel" autoname="yes"/>. (The sequence
        <me>8.3 + 2.9 \times 2.80</me>
        does not work either!)

<subsection><title>Problem Solving</title>
<p>
    Problem solving often involves translating a real-life problem into a computer programming language, or, in our case, into algebraic expressions. We can then use algebra to solve the mathematical problem and interpret the solution in the context of the original problem. Here are some guidelines for problem solving with algebraic equations.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Guidelines for Problem Solving</title>
<p>
    <dl>
        <li><title>Step 1:</title><p>
            Identify the unknown quantity and assign a variable to represent it.
        </p></li>
        <li><title>Step 2:</title><p>
            Find some quantity that can be expressed in two different ways and write an equation.
        </p></li>
        <li><title>Step 3:</title><p>
            Solve the equation.
        </p></li>
        <li><title>Step 4:</title><p>
            Interpret your solution to answer the question in the problem.
        </p></li>
    </dl>
</p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    In step 1, begin by writing an English phrase to describe the quantity you are looking for. Be as specific as possible—if you are going to write an equation about this quantity, you must understand its properties! Remember that your variable must represent a numerical quantity. For example, <m>x</m> can represent the <em>speed</em> of a train, but not just “the train.”
</p>
<p>
    Writing an equation is the hardest part of the problem. Note that the quantity mentioned in step 2 will probably <em>not</em> be the same unknown quantity you are looking for, but the algebraic expressions you write <em>will</em> involve your variable. For example, if your variable represents the <em>speed</em> of a train, your equation might be about the <em>distance</em> the train traveled.

<subsection><title>Supply and Demand</title>
<p>
    The law of supply and demand is fundamental in economics. If you increase the price of a product, the supply increases because its manufacturers are willing to provide more of the product, but the demand decreases because consumers are not willing to buy as much at a higher price. The price at which the demand for a product equals the supply is called the <term index="yes">equilibrium price</term>.
</p>

<example>
    <p>
        The Coffee Connection finds that when it charges <m>p</m> dollars for a pound of coffee, it can sell <m>800 − 60p</m> pounds per month. On the other hand, at a price of <m>p</m> dollars a pound, International Food and Beverage will supply the Connection with <m>175 + 40p</m> pounds of coffee per month. What price should the Coffee Connection charge for a pound of coffee so that its monthly inventory will sell out?
    </p>
<solution>
    <p>
        <dl>
            <li><title>Step 1:</title><p>
                We are looking for the equilibrium price, <m>p</m>.
            </p></li>
            <li><title>Step 2:</title><p>
                The Coffee Connection would like the demand for its coffee to equal its supply. We equate the expressions for supply and for demand to obtain the equation
                <me>800 − 60p = 175 + 40p</me>
            </p></li>
            <li><title>Step 3:</title><p>
                Solve the equation. To get all terms containing the variable, <m>p</m>, on one side of the equation, we add <m>60p</m> to both sides and subtract <m>175</m> from both sides to obtain

                    </mrow>
                    <mrow>

<subsection><title>Percent Problems</title>
<p>
    Recall the basic formula for computing percents.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Percent Formula</title>
<p>
    <me>P = rW</me>
    the <term>P</term>art (or percent) = the percentage <term>r</term>ate <m>\times</m> the <term>W</term>hole Amount
</p></assemblage>

<p>
    A <term index="yes">percent increase</term> or <term index="yes">percent decrease</term> is calculated as a fraction of the <em>original</em> amount. For example, suppose you make <m>\$16.00</m> an hour now, but next month you are expecting a <m>5\%</m> raise. Your new salary should be
    <me>
        \stackrel{\text{Original salary}}{\$16.00} + \stackrel{\text{Increase}}{0.05(\$16.00)} = \stackrel{\text{New Salary}}{\$16.80}
    </me>
</p>
<example xml:id="example-percent-increase">
    <p>
        The price of housing in urban areas increased <m>4\%</m> over the past year. If a certain house costs <m>\$100,000</m> today, what was its price last year?

            <li><title>Step 2:</title><p>
                Express the current price of the house in two different ways. During the past year, the price of the house increased by <m>4\%</m>, or <m>0.04c</m>. Its current price is thus
                <me>\stackrel{\text{Original cost}}{(1)c} + \stackrel{\text{Price increase}}{0.04c} = c(1 + 0.04) = 1.04c</me>
                This expression is equal to the value given for current price of the house:
                <me>1.04c = 100,000</me>
            </p></li>
            <li><title>Step 3:</title><p>
                To solve this equation, we divide both sides by <m>1.04</m> to find
                <me>c = \frac{100,000}{1.04}= 96,153.846</me>

            <li><title>Step 4:</title><p>
                To the nearest cent, the cost of the house last year was <m>\$96,153.85</m>.

<warning>
    <p>
        In <xref ref="example-percent-increase" autoname="yes"/>, it would be incorrect to calculate last year's price by subtracting <m>4\%</m> of <m>\$100,000</m> from <m>\$100,000</m> to get <m>\$96,000</m>. (Do you see why?)

<subsection><title>Weighted Averages</title>
<p>
    We find the <term index="yes">average</term>, or <term index="yes">mean</term>, of a set of values by adding up the values and dividing the sum by the number of values. Thus, the average, <m>\overline{x}</m>, of the numbers <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n</m> is given by
    <me>
        \overline{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ·· ·+x_n}{n}
    </me>
    In a <term index="yes">weighted average</term>, the numbers being averaged occur with different frequencies or are weighted differently in their contribution to the average value. For instance, suppose a biology class of 12 students takes a 10-point quiz. Of the 12 students, 2 receive 10s, three receive 9s, 5 receive 8s, and 2 receive scores of 6. The average score earned on the quiz is then
    <me>\overline{x} = \frac{\alert{2}(10) + \alert{3}(9) + \alert{5}(8) + \alert{2}(6)}{12}=8.25</me>
    The numbers in color are called the weights—in this example they represent the number of times each score was counted. Note that <m>n</m>, the total number of scores, is equal to the sum of the weights:
    <me>12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 2</me>
</p>

<example xml:id="example-weighted-average">

        Kwan's grade in his accounting class will be computed as follows: Tests count for <m>50\%</m> of the grade, homework counts for <m>20\%</m>, and the final exam counts for <m>30\%</m>.

                Kwan's grade is the weighted average of his test, homework, and final exam scores.

    In step 2 of <xref ref="example-weighted-average" autoname="yes"/>, we rewrote the formula for a weighted average in a simpler form.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Weighted Average</title><index>weighted average</index>
<p>
    The sum of the weighted values equals the sum of the weights times the average value. In symbols,
    <me>w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \cdots + w_nx_n = Wx</me>
    where <m>W</m> is the sum of the weights.
</p></assemblage>

<p>
    This form is particularly useful for solving problems involving mixtures.
</p>

<example>
    <p>
        The vet advised Delbert to feed his dog Rollo with kibble that is no more than <m>8\%</m> fat. Rollo likes JuicyBits, which are <m>15\%</m> fat.

                In this problem, we want the weighted average of the fat contents in the two kibbles to be <m>8\%</m>. The weights are the number of pounds of each kibble we use. It is often useful to summarize the given information in a table.

<section xml:id="appendix-Graphs-and-Equations"><title>Graphs and Equations</title>
<p>
    Graphs are useful tools for studying mathematical relationships. A graph provides an overview of a quantity of data, and it helps us identify trends or unexpected occurrences. Interpreting the graph can help us answer questions about the data.
</p>
<p>
    For example, here are some data showing the atmospheric pressure at different altitudes. Altitude is given in feet, and atmospheric pressure is given in inches of mercury.
    <table><tabular halign="center" left="minor" right="minor" top="minor" bottom="minor"><col halign="left"/>
        <row>
            <cell>Altitude (ft)</cell>
            <cell><m>0</m></cell>
            <cell><m>5000</m></cell>
            <cell><m>10,000</m></cell>
            <cell><m>20,000</m></cell>
            <cell><m>30,000</m></cell>
            <cell><m>40,000</m></cell>
            <cell><m>50,000</m></cell>
        </row>
        <row>
            <cell>Pressure (in. Hg)</cell>
            <cell><m>29.7</m></cell>
            <cell><m>24.8</m></cell>
            <cell><m>20.5</m></cell>
            <cell><m>14.6</m></cell>
            <cell><m>10.6</m></cell>
            <cell><m>8.5</m></cell>
            <cell><m>7.3</m></cell>
        </row>
    </tabular></table>
</p>
<p>
    We observe a generally decreasing trend in pressure as the altitude increases, but it is difficult to say anything more precise about this relationship. A clearer picture emerges if we plot the data. To do this, we use two perpendicular number lines called axes. We use the horizontal axis for the values of the first variable, altitude, and the vertical axis for the values of the second variable, pressure.
</p>
<p>
    The entries in the table are called <term>ordered pairs</term>, in which the <term>first component</term> is the altitude and the <term>second component</term> is the atmospheric pressure measured at that altitude. For example, the first two entries can be represented by <m>(0, 29.7)</m> and <m>(5000, 24.8)</m>. We plot the points whose <term>coordinates</term> are given by the ordered pairs, as shown in <xref ref="fig-pressure-vs-altitude" autoname="yes"/>a.
    <figure xml:id="fig-pressure-vs-altitude"><image source="images/fig-pressure-vs-altitude" alt="graphs of pressure vs altitude" /><caption></caption></figure>
</p>
<p>
    We can connect the data points with a smooth curve as shown in <xref ref="fig-pressure-vs-altitude" autoname="yes"/>b. In doing this, we are assuming that one variable changes smoothly with respect to the other, and in fact this is true for many physical situations. Thus, a smooth curve will thus serve as a good model.
</p>

<subsection><title>Reading a Graph</title>
<p>
    Once we have constructed a graph, we can use it to estimate values of the variables between the known data points.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-pressure-vs-altitude">
    <p>
        From the graph in <xref ref="fig-pressure-vs-altitude" autoname="yes"/>b, estimate the following: 
        <ol label="*a*">

                The atmospheric pressure measured at an altitude of <m>15,000</m> feet 
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                The altitude at which the pressure is <m>12</m> inches of mercury
            </p></li>
        </ol>
    </p>
<solution>
    <p>
        <ol label="*a*">

             The point on the graph with second coordinate <m>12</m> has first coordinate approximately <m>25,000</m>, so an atmospheric pressure of <m>12</m> inches of mercury occurs at about <m>25,000</m> feet.

<p>
    We can also use the graph to obtain information about the relationship between altitude and pressure that would be difficult to see from the data alone.

        <ol label="*a*">
            <li><p>
                For what altitudes is the pressure less than <m>18</m> inches of mercury?

            <li><p>
                How much does the pressure decrease as the altitude increases from <m>15,000</m> feet to <m>25,000</m> feet?

            <li><p>
                For which <m>10,000</m>-foot increase in altitude does the pressure change most rapidly?

    <p>
        <ol label="*a*">
            <li><p>
                From the graph in <xref ref="fig-pressure-vs-altitude" autoname="yes"/>b, we see that the pressure has dropped to <m>18</m> inches of mercury at about <m>14,000</m> feet, and that it continues to decrease as the altitude increases.

<subsection><title>Graphs of Equations</title>
<p>
    In <xref ref="example-pressure-vs-altitude" autoname="yes"/>, we used a graph to illustrate data given in a table. Graphs can also help us analyze models given by equations. Let us first review some facts about solutions of equations in two variables.
</p>
<p>
    An equation in two variables, such as y = 2x + 3, is said to be satisfied if the variables are replaced by a pair of numbers that make the statement true. The pair of numbers is called a <term index="yes">solution</term> of the equation and is usually written as an ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m>. (The first number in the pair is the value of <m>x</m> and the second number is the value of <m>y</m>.)
</p>
<p>
    To find a solution of a given equation, we can assign a number to one of the variables and then solve for the second variable.
</p>

<example>
    <p>
        Find solutions to the equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m>.
    </p>
<solution>
    <p>
        We choose some values for <m>x</m>, say, <m>-2</m>, <m>0</m>, and <m>1</m>. Substitute these <m>x</m>-values into the equation to find a corresponding <m>y</m>-value for each.
        <md>
            <mrow>
                \amp\text{When }x=−2,\amp\amp y = 2(\alert{−2}) + 3 =−1
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
                \amp\text{When }x=0,\amp\amp y = 2(\alert{0}) + 3 =3
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
                \amp\text{When }x=1,\amp\amp y = 2(\alert{1}) + 3 =5
            </mrow>
        </md>
        Thus, the ordered pairs <m>(−2, −1)</m>, <m>(0, 3)</m>, and <m>(1, 5)</m> are three solutions of <m>y = 2x + 3</m>. We can also substitute values for <m>y</m>. For example, if we let <m>y = \alert{10}</m>, we have
        <me>\alert{10} = 2x + 3</me>
        Solving this equation for <m>x</m>, we find <m>7 = 2x</m>, or <m>x = 3.5</m>. This means that the ordered pair <m>(3.5, 10)</m> is another solution of the equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m>.
    </p>
</solution></example>

<p>
    An equation in two variables may have infinitely many solutions, so we cannot list them all. However, we can display the solutions on a graph. For this we use a <term index="yes" >Cartesian</term> (or <term index="yes">rectangular</term>) <term index="yes" >coordinate system</term>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-coordinate-plane" autoname="yes"/>.
</p>
<sidebyside  widths="45% 45%" margins="auto">

    <figure xml:id="fig-line"><image source="images/fig-line" alt="line in the coordinate plane" /><caption></caption></figure>

</sidebyside>
<p>
    The <term index="yes" >graph of an equation</term> is a picture of its solutions. A point is included in the graph if its coordinates satisfy the equation, and if the coordinates do not satisfy the equation, the point is not part of the graph. A graph of <m>y = 2x + 3</m> is shown in <xref ref="fig-line" autoname="yes"/>.
</p>
<p>
    This graph does not display <em>all</em> the solutions of the equation, but it shows important features such as the intercepts on the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes. Because there is a solution corresponding to every real number <m>x</m>, the graph extends infinitely in either direction, as indicated by the arrows.
</p>

<example>
    <p>
        Use the graph of <m>y = 0.5x^2 − 2</m> in <xref ref="fig-parabola0" autoname="yes"/> to decide whether the given ordered pairs are solutions of the equation. Verify your answers algebraically.

    <p>
        <ol label="*a*">
            <li><p>
                Because the point <m>(−4, 6)</m> does lie on the graph, the ordered pair <m>x=−4, y = 6</m> is a solution of <m>y = 0.5x^2 − 2</m>. We can verify this by substituting <m>\alert{-4}</m> for <m>x</m> and <m>\blert{6}</m> for <m>y</m>:

<p>A <m>2\times 2</m> <term>system</term> of equations is a set of <m>2</m> equations in the same <m>2</m> variables. A <term index="yes">solution</term> of a <m>2\times 2</m> system is an ordered pair that makes each equation in the system true. In this section, we review two algebraic methods for solving <m>2\times 2</m> linear systems: substitution and elimination.</p>

<subsection><title>Solving Systems by Substitution</title>
<p>
    The basic strategy for the <term index="yes">substitution</term> method can be described as follows.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Steps for Solving a <n>2\tines 2</n> System by Substitution</title>
<p>
    <ol label="*1*">
        <li><p>
            Solve one of the equations for one of the variables in terms of the other.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Substitute this expression into the second equation; doing so yields an equation in one variable.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Solve the new equation.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Use the result of step 1 to find the other variable.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
</p>
</assemblage>

<example>
    <p>
        Staci stocks two kinds of sleeping bags in her sporting goods store, a standard model and a down-filled model for colder temperatures. From past experience, she estimates that she will sell twice as many of the standard variety as of the down filled. She has room to stock 60 sleeping bags at a time. How many of each variety should Staci order?
    </p>
<solution>
    <p>
        <dl>
            <li><title>Step 1:</title><p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>\amp\text{Number of standard sleeping bags: }~x</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp\text{Number of down-filled sleeping bags: }~y</mrow>
                </md>
            </p></li>
            <li><title>Step 2:</title><p>
                Write two equations about the variables. Staci needs twice as many standard model as down filled, so
                <md><mrow>x \amp = 2y\amp\amp\hphantom{blankety}(1)</mrow></md>
                Also, the total number of sleeping bags is 60, so
                <md><mrow>x+y \amp = 60\amp\amp\hphantom{blank}(2)</mrow></md>
            </p></li>
            <li><title>Step 3:</title><p>
                We will solve this system using substitution. Notice that Equation (1) is already solved for <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>: <m>x = 2y</m>. Substitute <m>\alert{2y}</m> for <m>x</m> in Equation (2) to obtain
                <md>
                    <mrow>
                        \alert{2y} + y \amp = 60

                    <mrow>3y\amp = 60</mrow>
                </md>
                Solving for <m>y</m>, we find <m>y=\alert{20}</m>. Finally, substitute this value into Equation (1) to find
                <me>x = 2(\alert{20}) = 40</me>
                The solution to the system is <m>x = 40, y = 20</m>.
            </p></li>
            <li><title>Step 4:</title><p>
                Staci should order <m>40</m> standard sleeping bags and <m>20</m> down-filled bags.

<subsection><title>Solving Systems by Elimination</title>
<p>
    The method of substitution is convenient if one of the variables in the system has a coefficient of <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m>, because it is easy to solve for that variable. If none of the coefficients is <m>1</m> or <m>-1s</m>, then a second method, called <term index="yes">elimination</term>, is usually more efficient.
</p>
<p>
    The method of elimination is based on the following properties of linear equations.

        Now add the corresponding terms of (1a) and (2a). The <m>x</m>-terms are eliminated, yielding an equation in one variable.

    In <xref ref="example-linear-combinations" autoname="yes"/>, we added <m>3</m> times the first equation to <m>-2</m> times the second equation. The result from adding a constant multiple of one equation to a constant multiple of another equation is called a <term index="yes">linear combination</term> of the two equations. The method of elimination is also called the method of linear combinations<index>linear combinations</index>.
</p>
<p>
    If either equation in a system has fractional coefficients, it is helpful to clear the fractions before applying the method of linear combinations.

        To eliminate the variable <m>x</m>, multiply Equation (2a) by <m>-1</m> and add the result to Equation (1a) to get

</p>
<subsection><title>Product of Powers</title>
<p>
    Consider a product of two powers with the same base.
    <me>(a^3) (a^2) = a a a \cdot a a = a^5</me>
    because <m>a</m> occurs as a factor five times. The number of <m>a</m>'s in the product is the <m>sum</m> of the number of  <m>a</m>'s in each factor.
</p>

<assemblage><title>First Law of Exponents: Product of Powers</title>
<p>
    To multiply two powers with the same base, add the exponents and leave the base unchanged.
    <me>a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}</me>

<p>Here are some mistakes to avoid.</p>

<warning>
    <p>
        <ol label="*1*">
            <li><p>
                Note that we do not <em>multiply</em> the exponents when simplifying a product. For example,
                <me>b^4 \cdot b^2 \ne b^8</me>
                You can check this with your calculator by choosing a value for <m>b</m>, for instance, <m>b = 3</m>:

<subsection><title>Quotients of Powers</title>
<p>
    To reduce a fraction, we divide both numerator and denominator by any common factors.
    <me>
        \require{cancel} \require{color} \renewcommand{\CancelColor}{\blue}
        \frac{x^7}{x^4}=\frac{xxx\cancel{x}\cancel{x}\cancel{x}\cancel{x}}{\cancel{x}\cancel{x}\cancel{x}\cancel{x}}=\frac{x^3}{1}=x^3
    </me>
    We can obtain the same result more quickly by <em>subtracting</em> the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator.
    <me>\frac{x^7}{x^4}=x^{7-4}=x^3</me>
</p>
<p>
    What if the larger power occurs in the denominator of the fraction?
    <me>
        \frac{x^4}{x^7}=\frac{\cancel{x}\cancel{x}\cancel{x}\cancel{x}}{xxx\cancel{x}\cancel{x}\cancel{x}\cancel{x}}=\frac{1}{x^3}
    </me>
    In this case, we subtract the exponent of the numerator from the exponent of the denominator.
    <me>\frac{x^4}{x^7}=\frac{1}{x^{7-4}}=\frac{1}{x^3}</me>
    These examples suggest the following law.

<subsection><title>Power of a Power</title>
<p>
    Consider the expression <m>\left(a^4\right)^3</m>, the third power of <m>a^4</m>.
    <me>\left(a^4\right)^3=\left(a^4\right)\left(a^4\right)\left(a^4\right)
        =a^{4+4+4}=a^{12} \hphantom{blankblankblank}\text{Add exponents.}</me>
    We can obtain the same result by multiplying the exponents together.
    <me>\left(a^4\right)^3=a^{4 \,\cdot\, 3}=a^{12}</me>
</p>

<assemblage><title>Third Law of Exponents: Power of a Power</title>
<p>
    To raise a power to a power, keep the same base and multiply the exponents.
    <me>\left(a^m\right)^n = a^{mn}</me>
</p>
</assemblage>

<example>

<warning>
    <p>
        Notice the difference between the expressions
        <me>(x^3) (x^4) = x^{3+4} = x^7</me>
        and
        <me>\left(x^3\right)^4 = x^{3\, \cdot \, 4} = x^{12}</me>

The first expression is a product, so we add the exponents. The second expression raises a
power to a power, so we multiply the exponents.
    </p>

<subsection><title>Power of a Product</title>
<p>
    To simplify the expression <m>(5a)^3</m>, we use the associative and commutative laws to regroup the factors as follows.
    <md>
        <mrow>
            (5a)^3 \amp = (5a) (5a) (5a)

        <mrow>
            \amp = 5^3 a^3

    Thus, to raise a product to a power, we can simply raise each factor to the power.

<assemblage><title>Fourth Law of Exponents: Power of a Product</title>

    A power of a product is equal to the product of the powers of each of its factors.
