            <p>You may have heard that mathematics is the language of science.  In fact, professionals in nearly every discipline take advantage of mathematical methods to analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change.  This process is called <term>mathematical modeling</term>.  A model is a simplified representation of reality that helps us understand a process or phenomenon.  Because it is a simplification, a model can never be completely accurate.  Instead, it should focus on those aspects of the real situation that will help us answer specific questions. Here is an example. </p>
            
            <p>The world's population is growing at different rates in different nations.  Many factors, including economic and social forces, influence the birth rate.  Is there a connection between birth rates and education levels?  The figure shows the birth rate plotted against the female literacy rate in 148 countries.  Although the data points do not all lie precisely on a line, we see a generally decreasing trend:  the higher the literacy rate, the lower the birth rate.  The <term>regression line</term> provides a model for this trend, and a tool for analyzing the data.  In this chapter we study the properties of linear models and some techniques for fitting a linear model to data.</p>

            <statement>
            <p>Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment. He will be paid <dollar />1000 per month plus a 6<percent /> commission on his sales. The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about <dollar />8000 worth of equipment per month. To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations.</p> 
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Based on the sales manager’s estimate, what monthly income can Delbert expect from this job? What annual salary would that provide?</p></li>
                    <li><p>What would Delbert’s monthly salary be if he sold only <dollar />5000 of equipment per month? What would his salary be if he sold <dollar />10,000 worth per month? Compute monthly incomes for each sales total shown in the table.</p>
