    <title>Projects for Chapter 2: Periodic Functions</title>

<project><title>Part I</title><p>
    A <term index="yes">periodic function</term> is one whose values repeat at evenly spaced intervals, or <term index="yes">periods</term>, of the input variable. Periodic functions are used to model phenomena that exhibit cyclical behavior, such as growth patterns in plants and animals, radio waves, and planetary motion. In this project, we consider some applications of periodic functions.
</p>
<example><p>
    Which of the functions in <xref ref="fig-chap2-proj-example-1" autoname="yes"/> are periodic? If the function is periodic, give its period.

<exercises><title>Exercise Set 1</title>
<exercise number="1"><statement><p>Which of the functions are periodic? If the function is
periodic, give its period.
<image source="images/fig-chap2-proj-ex-1-1" alt="three curves"/>
</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="2"><statement><p>Which of the following graphs are periodic? If the graph is periodic, give its period.
<image source="images/fig-chap2-proj-ex-1-2" alt="four curves"/>
</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="3"><statement><p>
    Match each of the following situations with the appropriate graph.
<image source="images/fig-chap2-proj-ex-1-3" alt="four curves"/>
<ol label="*a*">
    <li><p>When the heart contracts, blood pressure in the arteries rises rapidly to a peak (systolic blood pressure) and then falls off quickly to a minimum (diastolic blood pressure). Blood pressure is a periodic function of time.</p></li>
    <li><p>After an injection is given to a patient, the amount of the drug present in his bloodstream decreases exponentially. The patient receives injections at regular intervals to restore the drug level to the prescribed level. The amount of the drug present is a periodic function of time.</p></li>
    <li><p>The monorail shuttle train between the north and south terminals at Gatwick Airport departs from the south terminal every 12 minutes. The distance from the train to the south terminal is a periodic function of time.</p></li>
    <li><p>Delbert gets a haircut every two weeks. The length of his hair is a periodic function of time.</p></li>
</ol>
</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="4"><statement><p>
    A patient receives regular doses of medication to maintain a certain level of the drug in his body. After each dose, the patient's body eliminates a certain percent of the medication before the next dose is administered. The graph shows the amount of the drug, in milliliters, in the patient's body as a function of time in hours.
    <image source="images/fig-chap2-proj-ex-1-4" alt="drug level over multiple doses" width="60%" />
<ol label="*a*">
    <li><p>How much of the medication is administered with each dose?</p></li>
    <li><p>How often is the medication administered?</p></li>
    <li><p>What percent of the drug is eliminated from the body between doses?</p></li>
</ol>
</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="5"><statement><p>
    You are sitting on your front porch late one evening, and you see a light coming down the road tracing out the path shown below, with distances in inches. You realize that you are seeing a bicycle light, fixed to the front wheel of the bike.
    <image source="images/fig-chap2-proj-ex-1-5" alt="path of light on wheel" width="60%" />
<ol label="*a*">
    <li><p>Approximately what is the period of the graph?</p></li>
    <li><p>How far above the ground is the light?</p></li>
    <li><p>What is the diameter of the bicycle wheel?</p></li>
</ol>
</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="6"><statement><p>
    The graph shows arterial blood pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), as a function of time.
    <image source="images/fig-chap2-proj-ex-1-6" alt="blood pressure" width="60%" />
<ol label="*a*">
    <li><p>What are the maximum (systolic) and minimum (diastolic) pressures? The <term>pulse pressure</term> is the difference of systolic and diastolic pressures. What is the pulse pressure?</p></li>
    <li><p>The <term>mean arterial pressure</term> is the diastolic pressure plus one-third of the pulse pressure. Calculate the mean arterial pressure and draw a horizontal line on the graph at that pressure.</p></li>
    <li><p>The blood pressure graph repeats its cycle with each heartbeat. What is the heart rate, in beats per minute, of the person whose blood pressure is shown in the graph?</p></li>
</ol>
</p></statement></exercise>

<project><title>Part II</title><p>
    Many periodic functions have a characteristic wave shape like the graph shown in Figure 2.55. These graphs are called <term index="yes">sinusoidal</term>, after the trigonometric functions sine and cosine. They are often described by three parameters: the <term index="yes">period</term>, <term index="yes">midline</term>, and <term index="yes">amplitude</term>.</p>
    <p>
    The period of the graph is the smallest interval of input values on which the graph repeats. The midline is the horizontal line at the average of the maximum and minimum values of the output variable. The amplitude is the vertical distance between the maximum output value and the midline.
