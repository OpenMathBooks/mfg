			<li><title>absolute value</title>
			<p>
				<em>n</em>, the distance on the number line from a number to <m>0</m>. For example, the absolute value of <m>-7</m> is <m>7</m>. This fact is expressed by the equation <m>\abs{-7} = 7</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>absolute value equation</title>
			<p>
				 <em>n</em>, an equation in which the variable occurs between the absolute value bars.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>absolute value inequality</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, an inequality in which the variable occurs between the absolute value bars.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>algebraic expression</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, a meaningful combination of numbers, variables, and operation symbols. Also called an <em>expression</em>.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>algebraic fraction</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, a fraction whose numerator and denominator are polynomials. Also called a <em>rational expression</em>.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>algebraic solution</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, a method for solving equations (or inequalities) by manipulating the equations (or inequalities). Compare with <em>graphical solution</em> and <em>numerical solution</em>.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>allometric equation</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, an equation showing the (approximate) relationship between a living organism's body mass and another of the organism's properties or processes, usually given in the form <m>y = k (\text{mass})^p</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>altitude</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, (i) the distance above the ground or above sea level; (ii) the vertical distance between the base and the opposite vertex of a triangle, pyramid, or cone; (iii) the distance between parallel sides of a parallelogram, trapezoid, or rectangle. Also called <em>height</em>.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>amortization</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, the payment of a debt through regular installments over a period of time.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>amount</title><p>
				 (in an interest-bearing account), <em>n</em>, the sum of the principal that was invested and all the interest earned.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>amplitude</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, the vertical distance between the midline and the maximum value of a sinusoidal function.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>annuity</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, sequence of equal payments or deposits made at equal time intervals.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>approximation</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, an inexact result.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>area</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, a measure of the two-dimensional space enclosed by a polygon or curve, typically expressed in terms of square units, such as square meters or square feet, etc.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>ascending powers</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, an ordering of the terms of a polynomial so that the exponents on the variable are increasing, such as in the polynomial <m>1 + x + x^2</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>associative law of addition</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, the property that when adding three or more terms, the grouping of terms does not affect the sum. We express this formally by saying that if <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are any numbers, then <m>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>associative law of multiplication</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, the property that when multiplying three or more factors, the grouping of factors does not affect the product. We express this formally by saying that if <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are any numbers, then <m>(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>asymptote</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, a reference line (or curve) towards which the graph of an equation tends as the value of x and/or y grows or diminishes without bound.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>augmented matrix (for a linear system with <m>n</m> variables in standard form),</title><p>
				  <em>n</em>, the matrix obtained by making each row of the matrix correspond to an equation of the system, with the coefficients of the variables filling the first <m>n</m> columns, and the last (that is, the <m>n + 1</m>) column having the constants.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>axis</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, (<em>plural</em> <term>axes</term>), a line used as a reference for position and/or orientation.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>axis of symmetry</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, a line that cuts a plane figure into two parts, each a mirror image of the other.

			</p></li>
			<li><title>bar graph</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, a picture of numerical information in which the lengths or heights of bars are used to represent the values of variables.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>base</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, (i) a number or algebraic expression that is used as a repeated factor, where an exponent indicates how many times the base is used as a factor. For example, when we write <m>3^5</m>, the base is <m>3</m>. (ii) The bottom side of a polygon. (iii) The bottom face of a solid.
			</p></li>

			<li><title>build (a fraction)</title><p>
				  <em>v</em>, to find an equivalent fraction by multiplying numerator and denominator by the same nonzero expression.
			</p></li>
			<li><title>building factor</title><p>
				<em>n</em>, an expression by which both numerator and denominator of a given fraction are multiplied (in order to build the fraction).
