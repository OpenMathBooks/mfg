<p id="p-3378">If the Earth were not tilted on its axis, there would be 12 daylight hours every day all over the planet. But in fact, the length of a day in a particular location depends on the latitude and the time of year. The graph in Figure 2.26 shows \(H = f (t)\), the length of a day in Helsinki, Finland, \(t\) days after January 1, and \(R = g(t)\), the length of a day in Rome. Each is expressed as the number of hours greater or less than 12. Write a formula for \(f\) in terms of \(g\). What does this formula tell you?</p>
