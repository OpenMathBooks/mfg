    The body mass index, or BMI, is one measure of a person’s physical fitness. Your body mass index is defined by
    <div class="displaymath" id="me-209">\begin{equation*}BMI = wh^{−2}\end{equation*}</div>
    where \(w\) is your weight in kilograms and \(h\) is your height in meters. The World Health Organization classifies a person as obese if his or her BMI is \(25\) or higher.
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-422">a. Calculate the BMI for a woman who is \(1.625\) meters (\(64\) inches) tall and weighs \(54\) kilograms (\(120\) pounds).</li>
<li id="li-423">For a fixed weight, how does BMI vary with height?</li>
<li id="li-424">The world’s heaviest athlete is the amateur sumo wrestler Emanuel Yarbrough, who weighs \(319\) kg (\(704\) pounds). What height would Yarbrough have to be to have a BMI under \(25\)?</li>
</ol>
<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-80" id="solution-80"><span class="heading"><span class="type">Solution</span></span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-80" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="solution"><p id="p-648"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-425">\(BMI = 54(1.625^{−2})= 54(\frac{1}{1.625^2}= 20.45\)</li>
<li id="li-426">\(BMI = wh^{−2} = \frac{w}{h^2}\), so BMI varies inversely with the square of height. That is, for a fixed weight, BMI decreases as height increases.</li>
<li id="li-427">To find the height that gives a BMI of \(25\), we solve the equation \(25 = 319h^{−2}\). Note that the variable \(h\) appears in the denominator of a fraction, so we begin by clearing the denominator—in this case we multiply both sides of the equation by \(h^2\).
    \begin{align*}
    25 \amp = \frac{319}{h^2} \amp\amp \text{Multiply both sides by }h^2.\\
    25h^2 \amp = 319 \amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by }25.\\
    h^2 \amp = 12.76 \amp\amp \text{Extract square roots.}\\ 
    h \amp\approx 3.57
    \end{align*}
    To have a BMI under \(25\), Yarbrough would have to be over \(3.57\) meters, or \(11\) feet \(8\) inches tall. (In fact, he is \(6\) feet \(8\) inches tall.)</li>
