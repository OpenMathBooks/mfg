        For astronomers, the mass of a star is its most important property, but it is also the most difficult to measure directly. For many stars, their luminosity, or brightness, varies roughly as the fourth power of the mass.
    </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-493">Our Sun has luminosity \(4 \times 1026\) watts and mass \(2 \times 1030\) kilograms. Because the numbers involved are so large, astronomers often use these solar constants as units of measure: The luminosity of the Sun is \(1\) solar luminosity, and its mass is \(1\) solar mass. Write a power function for the luminosity, \(L\), of a star in terms of its mass, \(M\), using units of solar mass and solar luminosity.</li>
<li id="li-494">The star Sirius is \(23\) times brighter than the Sun, so its luminosity is \(23\) solar luminosities. Estimate the mass of Sirius in units of solar mass.</li>
</ol>
<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-83" id="solution-83"><span class="heading"><span class="type">Solution</span></span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-83" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="solution"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-495">Because \(L\) varies as the fourth power of \(M\), we have
        <div class="displaymath" id="me-230">\begin{equation*}L = kM^4\end{equation*}</div>
        Substituting the values of \(L\) and \(M\) for the Sun (namely, \(L = 1\) and \(M = 1\)), we find
        <div class="displaymath" id="me-231">\begin{equation*}1 = k(1)^4\end{equation*}</div>
        so \(k = 1\) and \(L = M^4\).</li>
<li id="li-496">We substitute the luminosity of Sirius, \(L = 23\), to get
        <div class="displaymath" id="me-232">\begin{equation*}23 = M^4\end{equation*}</div>
        To solve the equation for \(M\), we raise both sides to the \(\frac{1}{4}\) power.
        \begin{align*}
        (23)^{1/4} \amp = \left(M^4\right)^{1/4} \\
        2.1899 \amp = M
        \end{align*}
        The mass of Sirius is about \(2.2\) solar masses, or about \(2.2\) times the mass of the Sun.</li>
