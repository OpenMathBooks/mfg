		Each week, the Healthy Food Store buys both granola and muesli in bulk from two cereal companies. The store requires at least \(12\) kilograms of granola and \(9\) kilograms of muesli. Company A charges \(\$15\) for a package that contains \(2\) kilograms of granola and \(1\) kilogram of muesli. Company B charges \(\$25\) for a package of \(3\) kilograms of granola and \(3\) kilograms of muesli. How much should the Healthy Food Store purchase from each company in order to minimize its costs and still meet its needs for granola and muesli? What is the minimum cost?
