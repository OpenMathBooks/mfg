    Manufacturers of ships (and other complex products) find that the average cost of producing a ship decreases as more of those ships are produced. This relationship is called the <em class="terminology">experience curve</em>, given by the equation 
    \begin{equation*}C = ax^{âˆ’b}\end{equation*}
    where \(C\) is the average cost per ship in millions of dollars and \(x\) is the number of ships produced. The value of the constant \(b\) depends on the complexity of the ship. (Source: Storch, Hammon, and Bunch, 1988)
