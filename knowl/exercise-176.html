            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-732"><p id="p-1118">\(f (1985) = 41\): The federal debt in \(1985\) was about \(41\%\) of the gross domestic product.</p></li>
<li id="li-733"><p id="p-1119">\(t = 1942\) or \(t = 1955\): The federal debt was \(70\%\) of the gross domestic product in \(1942\) and \(1955\).</p></li>
<li id="li-734"><p id="p-1120">In about \(1997\), the debt was about \(67\%\) of the gross domestic product, so \(f (1997)\approx 67.3\).</p></li>
<li id="li-735"><p id="p-1121">The percentage basically dropped from 1946 to 1973, but there were small rises around 1950, 1954, 1958, and 1968, so the longest time interval was from 1958 to 1967.</p></li>
