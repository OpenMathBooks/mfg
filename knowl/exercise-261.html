    The incubation time for birds' eggs is given by
    \begin{equation*}I(m) = 12.0m^{0.217}\end{equation*}
    where \(m\) is the weight of the egg in grams, and \(I\) is in days. (See Problem 43.) Before hatching, the eggs take in oxygen at the rate of
    \begin{equation*}O(m) = 22.2m^{0.77}\end{equation*}
    in milliliters per day. (Source: Burton, 1998)
