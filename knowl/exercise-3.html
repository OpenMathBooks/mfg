<p id="p-58">Silver Lake has been polluted by industrial waste products.  The concentration of toxic chemicals in the water is currently 285 parts per million (ppm).  Local environmental officials would like to reduce the concentration by 15 ppm each year</p>
<ol xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-35"><p id="p-59">Complete the table of values showing the desired concentration, \(C,\)Â  of toxic chemicals \(t\) years from now.  For each \(t\)-value, calculate the corresponding value for \(C\).  Write your answers as ordered pairs.</p></li>
<li id="li-36"><p id="p-60">To choose scales for the axes, notice that the value of \(C\) starts at 285 and decreases from there.  We'll scale the vertical axis up to 300, and use 10 tick marks at intervals of 30.  Graph the ordered pairs on the grid, and connect them with a straight line. Extend the graph until it reaches the horizontal axis, but no farther.  Points with negative \(C\)-coordinates have no meaning for the problem.</p></li>
<li id="li-37"><p id="p-61">Write an equation for the concentration, \(C\), of toxic chemicals \(t\) years from now.  (Hint:  The concentration is initially 8 ppm, and we subtract 15 ppm for each year that passes, or \(15 \times t\).)</p></li>
