<p id="p-1552">The owner of a print shop volunteers to produce flyers for his candidate's campaign. His large printing press can complete the job in \(4\) hours, and the smaller model can finish the flyers in \(6\) hours. How long will it take to print the flyers if he runs both presses simultaneously? </p>
<ol id="ol-236" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-758"><p id="p-1553">Suppose that the large press can complete a job in \(t_1\) hours and the smaller press takes \(t_2\) hours. Write expressions for the fraction of a job that each press can complete in \(1\) hour.</p></li>
<li id="li-759"><p id="p-1554">Write an expression for the fraction of a job that can be completed in \(1\) hour with both presses running simultaneously.</p></li>
