   In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded because of O-ring failure on a morning when the temperature was about \(30\degree\)F. Previously, there had been one incident of O-ring failure when the temperature was \(70\degree\)F and three incidents when the temperature was \(54\degree\)F. Use linear extrapolation to estimate the number of incidents of O-ring failure you would expect when the temperature is \(30\degree\)F.
