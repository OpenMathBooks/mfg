		Leon is flying his plane to Au Gres, Michigan. He maintains a constant altitude until he passes over a marker just outside the neighboring town of Omer, when he begins his descent for landing. During the descent, his altitude, in feet, is given by
		\begin{equation*}
			A(x) = 128x^3 − 960x^2 + 8000
		\end{equation*}
		where \(x\) is the number of miles Leon has traveled since passing over the marker in Omer.
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-2234"><p id="p-3866">
				What is Leon’s altitude when he begins his descent?
