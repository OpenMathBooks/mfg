    How far can you throw a baseball? The distance depends on the initial speed of the ball, \(v\), and on the angle at which you throw it. For maximum range, you should throw the ball at \(45\degree\).
    </p>
<ol id="ol-70" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-232"><p id="p-335">If there were no air resistance, the height, \(x\), of the ball t seconds after its release would be given in meters by the formula
        \begin{equation*}h=\frac{vt}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{gt^2}{2} \end{equation*}
        where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Find an expression for the total time the ball is in the air. (<!--Style me with CSS--><em>Hint</em>: Set \(h=0\) and solve for \(t\) in terms of the other variables.)</p></li>
<li id="li-233"><p id="p-336">At time \(t\), the ball has traveled a horizontal distance \(d\) given by
        \begin{equation*}d=\frac{vt}{\sqrt{2}} \end{equation*}
        Find an expression for the range of the ball in terms of its velocity, \(v\). (<!--Style me with CSS--><em>Hint</em>: In part (a), you found an expression for \(t\) when \(h = 0\). Use that value of \(t\) to calculate \(d\) when \(h=0\).)</p></li>
<li id="li-234"><p id="p-337">The fastest baseball pitch on record was \(45\) meters per second, or about \(100\) miles per hour. Use your formula from part (b) to calculate the theoretical range of such a pitch. The value of \(g\) is \(9.8\).</p></li>
<li id="li-235"><p id="p-338">The maximum distance a baseball has actually been thrown is \(136\) meters. Can you explain the discrepancy between this figure and your answer to part (c)?</p></li>
