    Due to improvements in technology, the annual electricity cost of running most major appliances has decreased steadily since \(1970\). The average annual cost of running a refrigerator is given, in dollars, by the function
    \begin{equation*}C(t) = 148- 28 t^{1/3}\end{equation*}
    where \(t\) is the number of years since \(1970\).
