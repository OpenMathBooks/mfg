    Richard and Marian are moving to Parkville to take jobs after they graduate. The main road through Parkville runs east and west, crossing a river in the center of town. Richard's job is located \(10\) miles east of the river on the main road, and Marian's job is \(6\) miles west of the river. There is a health club they both like located \(2\) miles east of the river. If they plan to visit the health club every workday, where should Richard and Marian look for an apartment to minimize their total daily driving distance?
