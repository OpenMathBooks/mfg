If you order \(20\) or fewer boxes, the price is \(\$2.50\) each. If you order more than \(20\) but no more than \(50\) boxes, the price is \(\$2.25\) each. If you order more than \(50\) boxes, the price is \($2.10\) each. State the domain and range of \(C(x)\), the cost of ordering \(x\) boxes of toggle bolts.
