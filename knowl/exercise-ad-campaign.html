<p id="p-852">
	During an advertising campaign in a large city, the makers of Chip-O’s corn chips estimate that the number of people who have heard of Chip-O’s increases by a factor of \(8\) every 4 days.
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-684">
			If 100 people are given trial bags of Chip-O's to start the campaign, write a function, \(N(t)\), for the number of people who have heard of Chip-O's after \(t\) days of advertising.
		</li>
<li id="li-685">
			Use your calculator to graph the function \(N(t)\) on the domain \(0 \le t \le 15\).
		</li>
<li id="li-686">
			How many days should the makers run the campaign in order for Chip-O's to be familiar to \(51,200\) people? Use algebraic methods to find your answer and verify on your graph.
		</li>
</ol>
