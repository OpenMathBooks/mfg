A new car begins to depreciate in value as soon as you drive it off the lot. Some models depreciate linearly, and others depreciate exponentially. Suppose you buy a new car for $\(20,000\), and \(1\) year later its value has decreased to $\(17,000\).
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-871">
        If the value decreased linearly, what was its annual rate of decrease?
    </li>
<li id="li-872">
        If the value decreased exponentially, what was its annual decay factor? What was its annual percent depreciation?
    </li>
<li id="li-873">
        Calculate the value of your car when it is \(5\) years old under each assumption, linear or exponential depreciation.
    </li>
