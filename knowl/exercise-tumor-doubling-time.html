	The formula \(T = \frac{\log 2 \cdot t_i}{3 log(D_f /D_0)}\) is used by X-ray technicians to calculate the doubling time of a malignant tumor. \(D_0\) is the diameter of the tumor when first detected, \(D_f\) is its diameter at the next reading, and \(t_i\) is the time interval between readings, in days. Calculate the doubling time of a tumor if its diameter when first detected was \(1\) cm, and \(1.05\) cm \(7\) days later.
