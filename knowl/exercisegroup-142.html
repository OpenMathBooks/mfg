    At a ski slope, the lift chairs take \(5\) minutes to travel from the bottom, at an elevation of \(3000\) feet, to the top, at elevation \(4000\) feet. The cable supporting the ski lift chairs is a loop turning on pulleys at a constant speed. At the top and bottom, the chairs are at a constant elevation for a few seconds to allow skiers to get on and off.
