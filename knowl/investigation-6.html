    Small animals such as bats cannot survive for long without eating. The graph in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-vampire-bats.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-vampire-bats" alt="Figure 3.4.17 " title="Figure 3.4.17 ">Figure 3.4.17</a> shows how the weight, \(W\), of a typical vampire bat decreases over time until its next meal, until the bat reaches the point of starvation. The curve is the graph of the function
    \begin{equation*}W(h) = 130.25h^{−0.126}\end{equation*}
    where \(h\) is the number of hours since the bat’s most recent meal. (Source: Wilkinson, 1984)

        Suppose a bat that weighs \(80\) grams consumes \(5\) grams of blood. How many hours of life does it gain? Suppose a bat that weighs \(97.5\) grams gives up a meal of \(5\) grams of blood. How many hours of life does it forfeit?
    </li>
<li id="li-563">
        Vampire bats sometimes donate blood (through regurgitation) to other bats that are close to starvation. Suppose a bat at point \(A\) on the curve donates \(5\) grams of blood to a bat at point \(D\). Explain why this strategy is effective for the survival of the bat community.
