</h5>
<p id="p-17">Suppose a baseball player pops up, that is, hits the baseball straight up into the air. The height, \(h\text{,}\) of the baseball \(t\) seconds after it leaves the bat can be calculated using a formula from physics. This formula takes into account the initial speed of the ball (\(64\) feet per second) and its height when it was hit (\(4\) feet). The formula for the height of the ball (in feet) is
\begin{equation*}
h = −16t^2 + 64t + 4
\end{equation*}

<li id="li-2">Graph the height of the baseball as a function of time.
