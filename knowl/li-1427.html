<p id="p-2229">No: The degree or diploma attained is more significant than the number of years. So, for example, interpolation for the years of education between a bachelor's and master's degree may be inaccurate because earnings with just the bachelor's degree will not change until the master's degree is attained. And the years after the professional degree will not add significantly to earnings, so extrapolation is inappropriate.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="linear-regression.html#li-1427">in-context</a></span>
