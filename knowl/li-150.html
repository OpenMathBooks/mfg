        Let \(x\) represent the number of miles on the highway and \(f (x)\) the number of miles from the mall. For \(x\)-values less than \(15\), the graph is a straight line with slope \(−1\) and \(y\)-intercept at \((0, 15)\), so its equation is \(y = −x + 15\). Thus,
        <div class="displaymath" id="me-53">\begin{equation*}f (x) = −x + 15 \text{ when } 0 \le x \lt 15\end{equation*}</div>
        On the other hand, when \(x \ge 15\), the graph of \(f\) is a straight line with slope \(1\) that passes through the point \((15, 0)\). The point-slope form of this line is
        <div class="displaymath" id="me-54">\begin{equation*}y = 0 + 1(x − 15)\end{equation*}</div>
        so \(y = x − 15\). Thus,
        <div class="displaymath" id="me-55">\begin{equation*}f (x) = x − 15 \text{ when }  x \ge 15\end{equation*}</div>
        Combining the two pieces, we obtain
        <div class="displaymath" id="me-56">\begin{equation*}
        f (x) =
        \begin{cases}
        −x + 15 \amp \text{when } 0\le x\lt 15\\
        x − 15  \amp \text{when } x\ge 15
        \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}</div>
        The graph of \(f (x)\) is a part of the graph of \(y = \abs{x − 15}\). If we think of the highway as a portion of the real number line, with Marlene’s on-ramp located at the origin, then the outlet mall is located at \(15\). Marlene's coordinate as she drives along the highway is \(x\), and the distance from Marlene to the mall is given by \(f (x) = \abs{x − 15}\).
