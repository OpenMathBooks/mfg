				Although the cost is always increasing, it increases very slowly from about \(x = 5\) to about \(x = 11\). The flattening of the graph in this interval is a result of economy of scale: By buying supplies in bulk and using time efficiently, the cost per magazine can be minimized. However, if the production level is too large, costs begin to rise rapidly again.
