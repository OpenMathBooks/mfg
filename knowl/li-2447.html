</h5>From the table, we see that articles of any weight up to \(1\) ounce require $0.47 postage. This means that for all \(w\)-values greater than \(0\) but less than or equal to \(1\), the \(p\)-value is \(0.47\). Thus, the graph of \(p = g(w)\) between \(w = 0\) and \(w = 1\) looks like a small piece of the horizontal line \(p = 0.47\). Similarly, for all \(w\)-values greater than \(1\) but less than or equal to \(2\), the \(p\)-value is \(0.68\), so the graph on this interval looks like a small piece of the line \(p = 0.68\). Continue in this way to obtain the graph shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-postage-2016.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-postage-2016" alt="Figure 2.135 " title="Figure 2.135 ">FigureÂ 2.135</a>.
    <figure class="figure-like" id="fig-postage-2016"><object type="image/svg+xml" style="width:80%; margin:auto; display:block;" data="images/fig-postage-2016.svg" alt=""><p style="margin:auto">&lt;&lt;SVG image is unavailable, or your browser cannot render it&gt;&gt;</p></object><figcaption><span class="heading">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">2.135</span></figcaption></figure>
    The open circles at the left endpoint of each horizontal segment indicate that that point is not included in the graph; the closed circles are points on the graph. For instance, if \(w = 3\), the postage, \(p\), is $0.89, not $1.10. Consequently, the point \((3, 0.89)\) is part of the graph of \(g\), but the point \((3, 1.10)\) is not.
