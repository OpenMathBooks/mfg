</h5>Postage rates are given for all weights greater than \(0\) ounces up to and including \(7\) ounces, so the domain of the function is the half-open interval \((0, 7]\). (The domain is an interval because there is a point on the graph for every \(w\)-value from \(0\) to \(7\).) The range of the function is not an interval, however, because the possible values for \(p\) do not include all the real numbers between \(0.3\) and \(1.75\). The range is the set of discrete values \(0.47\), \(0.68\), \(0.89\), \(1.10\), \(1.31\), \(1.52\), and \(1.73\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="Domain-Range.html#li-384">in-context</a></span>
