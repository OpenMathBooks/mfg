<li id="li-787"><p id="p-1192">If energy consumption were proportional to body weight, the graph would be a straight line. But because the exponent in Kleiberâ€™s rule, \(\frac{3}{4}\), is less than \(1\), the graph is concave down, or bends downward. Therefore, larger species eat less than smaller ones, relative to their body weight. For example, a moose weighs \(600\) times as much as a squirrel, but its energy requirement is only \(121\) times the squirrel's.</p></li></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Rational-Exponents.html#li-787">in-context</a></span>
