	For many applications, it is important to know whether or not the inverse of \(f\) is a function. This can be determined from the graph of \(f\). When we interchange the roles of the input and output variables, horizontal lines of the form \(y = k\) become vertical lines. Thus, if the graph of the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>inverse</em> is going to pass the vertical line test, the graph of the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>original function</em> must pass the <em class="terminology">horizontal line test</em>, namely, that no horizontal line should intersect the graph in more than one point. Notice that the graph of \(f(x) = x^2\) does not pass the horizontal line test, so we would not expect its inverse to be a function.
