		A function may have an inverse function even if we cannot find its formula. The function \(f (x) = x^5 + x + 1\) shown in Figure 5.8a is one-to-one, so it has an inverse function. We can even graph the inverse function, as shown in Figure 5.8b, by interchanging the coordinates of points on the graph of \(f\). However, we cannot find a formula for the inverse function because we cannot solve the equation \(y = x^5 + x + 1\) for \(x\) in terms of \(y\).
