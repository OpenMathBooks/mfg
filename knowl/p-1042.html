    If you walk in the normal way, your maximum speed, \(v\), in meters per second, is limited by the length of your legs, \(r\), according to the formula
    \begin{equation*}v=\sqrt{gr} \end{equation*}
    where the constant \(\) is approximately \(10\) meters per second squared. (Source: Alexander, 1992)
