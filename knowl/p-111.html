<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Because we really only need two points to graph a linear equation, we might as well find the intercepts first and use them to draw the graph. The values of the intercepts will also help us choose suitable scales for the axes. It is always a good idea to find a third point as a check.
