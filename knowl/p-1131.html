    In Chapter 2, we learned that raising to powers and taking roots are inverse operations, that is, each operation undoes the effects of the other. This relationship is especially easy to see when the root is denoted by a fractional exponent. For example, to solve the equation 
    \begin{equation*}x^4 = 250\end{equation*}
    we would take the fourth root of each side. But instead of using radical notation, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power \(\frac{1}{4}\):
    \begin{align*}
    \left(x^4\right)^{1/4} \amp= 250^{1/4} \\
    x \amp \approx 3.98
    \end{align*}
    The third law of exponents tells us that \(\left(x^a\right)^b = x^{ab}\), so \(\left(x^4\right)^{1/4} = x^{(1/4)(4)} = x^1\). In general, to solve an equation involving a power function \(x^n\), we first isolate the power, then raise both sides to the exponent \(\frac{1}{n}\).
