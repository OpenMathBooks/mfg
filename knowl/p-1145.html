	By now, you have noticed that the values represented by points on a log scale increase rapidly as we move to the right along the scale. Also notice that \(10^0 = 1\), so the "middle" of a log scale represents \(1\) (not zero, as on a linear scale). Points to the left of \(10^0\) represent fractions between \(0\) and \(1\), because powers of \(10\) with negative exponents are numbers less than \(1\). Their values decrease toward \(0\) as we move to the left, but they never become negative. We cannot plot negative numbers or zero on a log scale, because the log of a negative number or zero is undefined.
