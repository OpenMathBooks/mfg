	In <a knowl="./knowl/investigation-height-of-baseball.html" knowl-id="xref-investigation-height-of-baseball" alt="Investigation 6.1 Height of a Baseball" title="Investigation 6.1 Height of a Baseball">Investigation 6.1</a>, the height of a baseball \(t\) seconds after being hit was given by
	\begin{equation*}h = −16t^2 + 64t + 4\end{equation*}
	We used a graph to find two times when the baseball was \(64\) feet high. Can we solve the same problem algebraically?
