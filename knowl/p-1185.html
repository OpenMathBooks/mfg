	We are looking for values of \(t\) that produce \(h = 64\) in the height equation. So, if we substitute \(h = 64\) into the height equation, we would like to solve the <em class="terminology">quadratic equation</em>s
	\begin{equation*}64 = âˆ’16t^2 + 64t + 4\end{equation*}
	This equation cannot be solved by extraction of roots, because there are two terms containing the variable \(t\), and they cannot be combined. To solve this equation, we will appeal to a property of our number system, called the <em class="terminology">zero-factor principle</em>.
