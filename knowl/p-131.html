    We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For example, when a physician prescribes a drug in a certain dosage, she needs to know how long the dose will remain in the bloodstream. A sales manager needs to know how the price of his product will affect its sales. A <em class="terminology">function</em> is a special type of relationship between variables that allows us to make such predictions.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="functions.html#p-131">in-context</a></span>
