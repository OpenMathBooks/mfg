	We can also use the discriminant to decide whether a quadratic equation can be solved by factoring. First, clear the equation of fractions. If the discriminant is a perfect square, that is, the square of an integer, the solutions are rational numbers. This in turn means that the equation can be solved by factoring. If the discriminant is not a perfect square, the solutions will be irrational. Irrational solutions always occur in conjugate pairs,
	\begin{equation*}\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} ~~~\text{and}~~~
		\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\end{equation*}
	The only difference between the two solutions is the sign between the terms. For example, if we know that one solution of a particular quadratic equation is \(3 +\sqrt{2}\), then the other solution must be \(3 -\sqrt{2}\).
