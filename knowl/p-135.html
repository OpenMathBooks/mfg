    For this relationship, we can find the value \(C\) of associated with any given value of \(t\). All we have to do is substitute the value of \(t\) into the equation and solve for \(C\). The result has no ambiguity: Only one value for \(C\) corresponds to each value of \(t\). This type of relationship between variables is called a <em class="terminology">function</em>. In general, we make the following definition.
