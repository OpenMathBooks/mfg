    We have defined the slope of a line to be the ratio \(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\) as we move from one point to another on the line. So far, we have computed \(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta x\) by counting squares on the graph, but this method is not always practical. All we really need are the coordinates of two points on the graph.
