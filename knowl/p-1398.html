<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
		The Chamber of Commerce in River City plans to put on a Fourth of July fireworks display. City regulations require that fireworks at public gatherings explode higher than \(800\) feet above the ground. The mayor particularly wants to include the Freedom Starburst model, which is launched from the ground. Its height after t seconds is given by
		\begin{equation*}h = 256t âˆ’ 16t^2\end{equation*}
		When should the Starburst explode in order to satisfy the safety regulation?
