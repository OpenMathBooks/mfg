<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The world's population is growing at different rates in different nations.  Many factors, including economic and social forces, influence the birth rate.  Is there a connection between birth rates and education levels?  The figure shows the birth rate plotted against the female literacy rate in 148 countries.  Although the data points do not all lie precisely on a line, we see a generally decreasing trend:  the higher the literacy rate, the lower the birth rate.  The <em class="terminology">regression line</em> provides a model for this trend, and a tool for analyzing the data.  In this chapter we study the properties of linear models and some techniques for fitting a linear model to data.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="chap1.html#p-14">in-context</a></span>
