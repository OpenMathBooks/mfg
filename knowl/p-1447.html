    The gourd species <em class="terminology">Tricosanthes</em> grows according to the formula \(L = ad^{2.2}\), where \(L\)  is its length and \(d\) is its width. The species <em class="terminology">Lagenaria</em> has the growth law \(L = ad^{0.81}\). (Source: Burton, 1998)

<li id="li-971"><p id="p-1448">By comparing the exponents, predict which gourd grows into a long, thin shape, and which is relatively fatter. Which species is called the snake gourd, and which is the bottle gourd?</p></li>
<li id="li-972"><p id="p-1449">The snake gourd reaches a length of \(2\) meters (\(200\) cm), with a diameter of only \(4\) cm. Find the value of a in its growth law.</p></li>
<li id="li-973"><p id="p-1450">The bottle gourd is \(10\) cm long and \(7\) cm in diameter at maturity. Find the value of a in its growth law.</p></li>
<li id="li-974"><p id="p-1451">The giant bottle gourd grows to a length of \(23\) cm with a diameter of \(20\) cm. Does it grow according to the same law as standard bottle gourds?</p></li>
