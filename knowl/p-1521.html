<p>A chartered sightseeing flight over the Grand Canyon is scheduled to return to its departure point in \(3\) hours. The pilot would like to cover a distance of \(144\) miles before turning around, and he hears on the Weather Service that there will be a headwind of \(20\) miles per hour on the outward journey.

<ol id="ol-231" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-733"><p id="p-1522">Express the time it takes for the outward journey as a function of the airspeed of the plane.</p></li>
<li id="li-734"><p id="p-1523">Express the time it takes for the return journey as a function of the speed of the plane.</p></li>
<li id="li-735"><p id="p-1524">Graph the sum of the two functions and find the point on the graph with \(y\)-coordinate \(3\text{.}\) Interpret the coordinates of the point in the context of the problem.</p></li>
<li id="li-736"><p id="p-1525">The pilot would like to know what airspeed to maintain in order to complete the tour in \(3\) hours. Write an equation to describe this situation.</p></li>
<li id="li-737"><p id="p-1526">Solve your equation to find the appropriate airspeed.</p></li>
