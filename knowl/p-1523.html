    The incubation time for a bird's egg is a function of the mass, \(m\), of the egg, and has been experimentally determined as
    \begin{equation*}I(m) = 12.0m^{0.217}\end{equation*}
    where \(m\) is measured in grams and \(I\) is in days. (Source: Burton, 1998)

<li id="li-1025"><p id="p-1524">Calculate the incubation time (to the nearest day) for the wren, whose eggs weigh about \(2.5\) grams, and the greylag goose, whose eggs weigh \(46\) grams.</p></li>
<li id="li-1026"><p id="p-1525">During incubation, birds' eggs lose water vapor through their porous shells. The rate of water loss from the egg is also a function of its mass, and it appears to follow the rule
        \begin{equation*}W(m) = 0.015m^{0.742}\end{equation*}
        in grams per day. Combine the functions \(I(m)\) and \(W(m)\) to calculate the fraction of the initial egg mass that is lost during the entire incubation period.</p></li>
<li id="li-1027"><p id="p-1526">Explain why your result shows that most eggs lose about \(18\%\) of their mass during incubation.</p></li>
