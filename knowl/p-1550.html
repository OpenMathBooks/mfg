	All these parabolas share certain features. The graph has either a highest point (if the parabola opens downward, as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-parabola-diagram.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-parabola-diagram" alt="Figure 6.3.1 " title="Figure 6.3.1 ">Figure 6.3.1</a>a) or a lowest point (if the parabola opens upward, as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-parabola-diagram.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-parabola-diagram" alt="Figure 6.3.1 " title="Figure 6.3.1 ">Figure 6.3.1</a>b). This high or low point is called the <em class="terminology">vertex</em> of the graph. The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line, called the <em class="terminology">axis of symmetry</em>, that runs through the vertex. The \(y\)-intercept is the point where the parabola intersects the \(y\)-axis. The graph of a quadratic function always has exactly one \(y\)-<em class="terminology">intercept</em>. However, the graph may cross the \(x\)-axis at one point, at two points, or not at all. Points where the parabola intersects the \(x\)-axis are called the \(x\)-<em class="terminology">intercepts</em>. If there are two \(x\)-intercepts, they are equidistant from the axis of symmetry.
