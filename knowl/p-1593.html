				Fixed costs are given by \(C(0) = 250\), or \(\$250\). The fixed costs include expenses like utility bills that must be paid even if no magazines are produced.

				The graph is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-GC-cubic-cost-function.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-GC-cubic-cost-function" alt="Figure 7.1.14 " title="Figure 7.1.14 ">Figure 7.1.14</a>a. It is increasing from a vertical intercept of \(250\). The graph is concave down for \(x \lt 8\) approximately, and concave up for \(x\gt 8\).

				We must solve the equation
				\begin{equation*}x^3 − 24x^2 + 195x + 250 = 1200\end{equation*}
				We will solve the equation graphically, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-GC-cubic-cost-function.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-GC-cubic-cost-function" alt="Figure 7.1.14 " title="Figure 7.1.14 ">Figure 7.1.14</a>b. Graph \(y = 1200\) along with the cost function, and use the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>intersect</em> command to find the intersection point of the graphs, \((15.319, 1200)\). \(C(x) = 1200\) when \(x\) is about \(15.319\), so \(15,319\) copies can be printed for \(\$1200\).

				Although the cost is always increasing, it increases very slowly from about \(x = 5\) to about \(x = 11\). The flattening of the graph in this interval is a result of economy of scale: By buying supplies in bulk and using time efficiently, the cost per magazine can be minimized. However, if the production level is too large, costs begin to rise rapidly again.
