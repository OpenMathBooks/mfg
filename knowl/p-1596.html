	Many quadratic models arise as the product of two variables, one of which increases while the other decreases. For example, the area of a rectangle is the product of its length and its width, or \(A = lw\). If we require that the rectangle have a certain perimeter, then as we increase its length, we must also decrease its width. (We analyzed this problem in <a knowl="./knowl/investigation-Perimeter-and-Area.html" knowl-id="xref-investigation-Perimeter-and-Area" alt="Investigation 3 Investigation: Perimeter and Area" title="Investigation 3 Investigation: Perimeter and Area">Investigation 3</a> of <a href="chap2.html" alt="Chapter 2 Modeling with Functions" title="Chapter 2 Modeling with Functions">Chapter 2</a>.)
