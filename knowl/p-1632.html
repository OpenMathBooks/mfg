	Because a polynomial function of degree \(n\) can have at most \(n\) linear factors of the form \((x − a)\), it follows that \(P\) can have at most \(n\) distinct zeros. Another way of saying this is that if \(P(x)\) is a polynomial of \(n\)th degree, the equation \(P(x) = 0\) can have at most \(n\) distinct solutions, some of which may be complex numbers. (We consider complex numbers in <a href="Complex-Numbers.html" alt="Section 7.3 Complex Numbers" title="Section 7.3 Complex Numbers">Section 7.3</a>.) Because only real-valued solutions appear on the graph as \(x\)-intercepts, we have the following corollary to the factor theorem.
