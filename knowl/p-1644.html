	Near its \(x\)-intercepts, the graph of a polynomial takes one of the characteristic shapes illustrated in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" alt="Figure 7.2.11 " title="Figure 7.2.11 ">FigureÂ 7.2.11</a>. (Although we will not consider zeros of multiplicity greater than three, they correspond to similar behavior in the graph: At a zero of odd multiplicity, the graph has an inflection point at the intercept; its graph makes an S-shaped curve. At a zero of even multiplicity, the graph has a turning point; it changes direction without crossing the \(x\)-axis.)
