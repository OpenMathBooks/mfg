<p>
    In the 1970s, McNeill Alexander proposed a relationship between an animal's running speed, \(v\), its hip height, \(h\), and its stride length, \(s\). If stride and hip height are measured in meters, the running speed is given in meters per second by
    \begin{equation*}v = f (h, s) = 0.78s^{1.67}h^{âˆ’1.17}\end{equation*}
    </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-1125"><p id="p-1700">What is the speed of a racehorse whose hip height is \(1.6\) meters and stride length is \(7\) meters?</p></li>
<li id="li-1126"><p id="p-1701">A cheetah can run at \(33\) meters per second. If its hip height is \(0.8\) meters, what is its stride length?</p></li>
<li id="li-1127"><p id="p-1702">A pronghorn antelope has the same stride length as a cheetah and its hip height is \(12\%\) greater than the cheetah's. How does its running speed compare to a cheetah's?</p></li>
