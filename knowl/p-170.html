        Marlene is driving to a new outlet mall on Highway 17. There is a gas station at Marlene's on-ramp, where she buys gas and resets her odometer to zero before getting on the highway. The mall is only 15 miles from Marlene’s on-ramp, but she mistakenly drives past the mall and continues down the highway. Marlene's distance from the mall is a function of how far she has driven on Highway 17. See <a knowl="./knowl/fig-Marlene-highway.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-Marlene-highway" alt="Figure 1.5.19 " title="Figure 1.5.19 ">Figure 1.5.19</a>.
