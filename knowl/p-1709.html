    In the Middle Ages in Europe, castles were built as defensive strongholds. An attacking force would build a huge catapult called a trebuchet to hurl rocks and scrap metal inside the castle walls. The engineers could adjust its range by varying the mass of the projectiles. The mass, \(m\), of the projectile should be inversely proportional to the square of the distance, \(d\), to the target.

<li id="li-856">Use a negative exponent to write \(m\) as a function of \(d\), \(m = f (d)\).</li>
<li id="li-857">The engineers test the trebuchet with a \(20\)-kilogram projectile, which lands \(250\) meters away. Find the constant of proportionality; then rewrite your formula for \(m\).</li>

<li id="li-859">The trebuchet is \(180\) meters from the courtyard within the castle. What size projectile will hit the target?</li>
<li id="li-860">The attacking force would like to hurl a \(100\)-kilogram projectile at the castle. How close must the attackers bring their trebuchet?</li>
