<li id="li-1143"><p id="p-1725">You would like to borrow \(\$100,000\) for \(20\) years. What interest rate, to the nearest percent, can you accept if your monthly payments must be no more than \(\$800\)? What interest rate can you accept if the loan is for \(30\) years? If \(P = f (r, t)\), use function notation to write both of these questions as inequalities.</p></li>
<li id="li-1144"><p id="p-1726">Suppose you borrow \(\$100,000\) for \(10\) years at \(10\%\) interest. Which would cause a greater reduction in your monthly payment: Reducing the interest rate by \(5\%\) or increasing the length of the loan by \(5\) years?</p></li>
<li id="li-1145"><p id="p-1727">At a fixed interest rate of \(8\%\), is the monthly payment a linear function of the length of the loan?</p></li>
<li id="li-1146"><p id="p-1728">For a fixed loan period of \(25\) years, is the monthly payment a linear function of interest rate?</p></li>
<li id="li-1147"><p id="p-1729">Does a \(1\%\) increase in the interest rate have a greater affect on the monthly payment for a \(15\)-year loan or a \(30\)-year loan?</p></li>
