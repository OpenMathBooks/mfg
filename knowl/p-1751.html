<p>We can see that the \(y\)-intercept of each line is given by the constant term, \(b\text{.}\) By examining the table of values, we can also see why the coefficient of \(x\)gives the slope of the line: For \(f (x)\text{,}\) each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) decreases by \(3\) units. For \(g(x)\text{,}\) each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) increases by \(2\) units. For each graph, the coefficient of \(x\) is a scale factor that tells us how many units \(y\) changes for \(1\) unit increase in \(x\text{.}\) But that is exactly what the slope tells us about a line.</p>
