    Railroad engineers use a transition curve between straight sections of track and bends, which are designed as arcs of circles. The length, \(L\), of the transition curve varies directly with the cube of the train's speed, \(v\), and inversely with the radius, \(R\), of the circular arc.
    </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-1196"><p id="p-1790">On a section of track where the speed limit is \(50\) mph, a circular bend has a radius of \(2000\) feet, and the transition curve is \(200\) feet long. Find the constant of variation and write a formula for \(L\) as a function of \(v\) and \(R\).</p></li>
<li id="li-1197"><p id="p-1791">If the speed limit is increased by \(20\%\), how is the length of the transition curve affected?</p></li>
