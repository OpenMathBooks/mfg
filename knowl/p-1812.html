	The function \(Y_1\) gives the time it takes Rani to paddle 30 miles downstream, and \(Y_2\) gives the time it takes her to paddle \(18\) miles upstream. Both of these times depend on the speed of the current, \(x\). We are looking for a value of \(x\) that makes \(Y_1\) and \(Y_2\) equal. This occurs at the intersection point of the two graphs, \((3, 2)\). Thus, the speed of the current is \(3\) miles per hour, as we found in <a knowl="./knowl/example-kayak-current.html" knowl-id="xref-example-kayak-current" alt="Example 7.5.4 " title="Example 7.5.4 ">ExampleÂ 7.5.4</a>. The y-coordinate of the intersection point gives the time Rani paddled on each part of her trip: \(2\) hours each way.
