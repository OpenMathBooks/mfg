	What went wrong with our method of solution? We multiplied both sides of the equation by \(x âˆ’ 3\), which is zero when \(x = 3\), so we really multiplied both sides of the equation by zero. Multiplying by zero does not produce an equivalent equation, and false solutions may be introduced. An apparent solution that does not satisfy the original equation is called an <em class="terminology">extraneous solution</em>. Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solution obtained is not excluded from the domain of the rational functions involved.
