	George Dantzig (1914â€“2005) invented the simplex method for solving linear programming problems in 1947. His first application of the method was to determine an adequate diet of least cost. This problem involved 9 equations in 77 unknowns and took 120 days to solve using the desk calculators available at the time. In this chapter, we use a graphing technique to solve problems in two unknowns. For example, the diet of the Columbian ground squirrel consists of two foods: grass and forb (a type of flowering weed). Small animals spend most of their time foraging for food, but they must also be alert for predators. Which foraging strategy favors survival: Should the squirrel try to satisfy its dietary requirements in minimum time, thus minimizing its exposure to predators and the elements, or should it try to maximize its intake of nutrients?
