		The manager for Books for Cooks plans to spend \(\$300\) stocking a new diet cookbook. The paperback version costs her \(\$5\), and the hardback costs \(\$10\). She finds that she will sell three times as many paperbacks as hardbacks. How many of each should she buy?
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-1298"><p id="p-1945">
				Let \(x\) represent the number of hardbacks and \(y\) the number of paperbacks she should buy. Write an equation about the cost of the books.
			</p></li>
<li id="li-1299"><p id="p-1946">
				Write a second equation about the number of each type of book.
			</p></li>
<li id="li-1300"><p id="p-1947">
				Graph both equations and solve the system. (Find the intercepts of the graphs to help you choose a window.) Answer the question in the problem.
			</p></li>
</ol>
