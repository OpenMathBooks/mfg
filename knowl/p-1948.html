	The owner of a retail business must try to balance the demand for his product from consumers with the supply he can obtain from manufacturers. Supply and demand both vary with the price of the product: Consumers usually buy fewer items if the price increases, but manufacturers will be willing to supply more units of the product if its price increases.
