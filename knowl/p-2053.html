<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>We would like to draw a line that comes as close as possible to all the data points, even though it may not pass precisely through any of them. In particular, we try to adjust the line so that we have the same number of data points above the line and below the line. One possible solution is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-gas-mileage2.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-gas-mileage2" alt="Figure 1.146 " title="Figure 1.146 ">FigureÂ 1.146</a>.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="linear-regression.html#p-2053">in-context</a></span>
