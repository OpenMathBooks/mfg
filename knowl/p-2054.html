	These properties apply to linear systems of any size. Thus, we can perform the following operations on the equations of a system:
	<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-1342"><p id="p-2055">
			Multiply both sides of an equation by a nonzero real number.
		</p></li>
<li id="li-1343">
<p id="p-2056">
			Add a constant multiple of one equation to another equation.</p>
<p id="p-2057">We can also perform the following operation without changing the solution of the system:
		</p>
</li>
<li id="li-1344"><p id="p-2058">
			Interchange two equations.
		</p></li>
</ol>
	Because each equation of the system corresponds to a row in the augmented matrix, the three operations above correspond to three elementary row operations for the augmented matrix. We can perform one or more of these operations on a matrix without changing the solution of the system it represents.
