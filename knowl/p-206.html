    We find the <em class="terminology">average</em>, or <em class="terminology">mean</em>, of a set of values by adding up the values and dividing the sum by the number of values. Thus, the average, \(\overline{x}\), of the numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n\) is given by
    \begin{equation*}
        \overline{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ·· ·+x_n}{n}
    \end{equation*}
    In a <em class="terminology">weighted average</em>, the numbers being averaged occur with different frequencies or are weighted differently in their contribution to the average value. For instance, suppose a biology class of 12 students takes a 10-point quiz. Of the 12 students, 2 receive 10s, three receive 9s, 5 receive 8s, and 2 receive scores of 6. The average score earned on the quiz is then
    \begin{equation*}\overline{x} = \frac{\alert{2}(10) + \alert{3}(9) + \alert{5}(8) + \alert{2}(6)}{12}=8.25\end{equation*}
    The numbers in color are called the weights—in this example they represent the number of times each score was counted. Note that \(n\), the total number of scores, is equal to the sum of the weights:
    \begin{equation*}12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 2\end{equation*}
