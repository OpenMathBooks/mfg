    We can also use interpolation and extrapolation to make estimates for nonlinear functions. Sometimes a variable relationship is not linear, but a portion of its graph can be approximated by a line. The graph in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-Emily-height.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-Emily-height" alt="Figure 1.158 " title="Figure 1.158 ">Figure 1.158</a> shows a child’s height each month. The graph is not linear because her rate of growth is not constant; her growth slows down as she approaches her adult height. However, over a short time interval the graph is close to a line, and that line can be used to approximate the coordinates of points on the curve.
