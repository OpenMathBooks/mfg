<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
	Ivana is investing in the hotel business. She has bought two hotels, and she will expand her investments when her total profit from the two hotels exceeds \(\$10,000\). If we let \(x\) represent the profit from one hotel and let \(y\) represent the profit from the other, then Ivana will expand her investments when
	\begin{equation*}
		x + y \ge 10,000
	\end{equation*}
	Notice that the equation \(x + y = 10,000\) is not appropriate to model our situation, since Ivana will be delighted if her profits are not exactly equal to \(\$10,000\) but actually exceed that amount.
