	Amore efficient way to find all the solutions of the inequality is to start with the graph of the corresponding equation
	\begin{equation*}
		y = −x + 10,000
	\end{equation*}
	The graph is a straight line, as illustrated in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-linear-inequality.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-linear-inequality" alt="Figure 8.4.1 " title="Figure 8.4.1 ">Figure 8.4.1</a>b. Observe that any point above this line has a y-coordinate greater than \(−x + 10,000\) and hence satisfies the inequality. Thus, the graph of the inequality includes all the points on or above the line \(y = −x + 10,000\), as shown by the shaded region in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-linear-inequality.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-linear-inequality" alt="Figure 8.4.1 " title="Figure 8.4.1 ">Figure 8.4.1</a>b.
