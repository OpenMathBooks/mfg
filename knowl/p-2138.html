	You can check that the shaded points are also solutions to the original inequality, \(x + y \ge 10,000\). Consider the point \((−1000, 12,000)\), which lies in the shaded region above the line. This pair does satisfy \(x + y \ge 10,000\), because
	\begin{equation*}
		−1000 + 12,000 \ge 10,000
	\end{equation*}
	(Ivana will expand her investments if her first hotel loses \(\$1000\) and her second has a profit of \(\$12,000\).) On the other hand, the point \((5000, 4000)\) does not lie in the graph of \(x + y \ge 10,000\), because the coordinates do not satisfy the inequality.
