	Each pair of Weekender boots requires \(3\) hours of labor to produce, and each pair of Sierra boots requires \(6\) hours. TrailGear has available \(2400\) hours of labor per week. Thus, \(x\) and \(y\) must satisfy the inequality
	\begin{equation*}3x + 6y \le 2400\end{equation*}
	In addition, suppose that TrailGear's suppliers can provide at most \(1000\) ounces of silicone gel each week, with each pair of Weekenders using \(2\) ounces and each Sierra model using \(1\) ounce. This means that
	\begin{equation*}2x + y \le 1000\end{equation*}
	Of course, we will also require that \(x\ge 0\) and \(y\ge 0\). These four inequalities are called the <em class="terminology">constraints</em> of the problem.
