    You are already familiar with square roots. Every nonnegative number has two square roots, defined as follows:
    \begin{equation*}s ~~\text{ is a square root of }~~ n ~~\text{ if }~~s^2 = n\end{equation*}
    There are several other kinds of roots, one of which is called the <em class="terminology">cube root</em>, denoted by \(\sqrt[3]{n}\). We define the cube root as follows.
