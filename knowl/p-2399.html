<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The owner of a movie theater needs to bring in \(\$1000\) at each screening in order to stay in business. He sells adult tickets at \(\$5\) apiece and children's tickets at \(\$2\) each.
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-1554"><p id="p-2400">Write an equation that relates the number of adult tickets, \(A\), he must sell and the number of children's tickets, \(C\).</p></li>
<li id="li-1555"><p id="p-2401">Find the intercepts and graph the equation by hand.</p></li>
<li id="li-1556"><p id="p-2402">If the owner sells \(120\) adult tickets, how many children's tickets must he sell?</p></li>
<li id="li-1557"><p id="p-2403">What is the significance of the intercepts to the sale of tickets?</p></li>
