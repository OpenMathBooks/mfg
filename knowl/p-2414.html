        Kwan's grade in his accounting class will be computed as follows: Tests count for \(50\%\) of the grade, homework counts for \(20\%\), and the final exam counts for \(30\%\). If Kwan has an average of \(84\) on tests and \(92\) on homework, what score does he need on the final exam to earn a grade of \(90\)?
