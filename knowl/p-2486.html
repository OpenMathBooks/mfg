        Staci stocks two kinds of sleeping bags in her sporting goods store, a standard model and a down-filled model for colder temperatures. From past experience, she estimates that she will sell twice as many of the standard variety as of the down filled. She has room to stock 60 sleeping bags at a time. How many of each variety should Staci order?
