	The graphs of these two functions are shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-gasoline-and-population-graphs.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-gasoline-and-population-graphs" alt="Figure 3.3 " title="Figure 3.3 ">FigureÂ 3.3</a>. We see that the price, \(P\), of a fill-up is a linear function of the number of gallons, \(g\), purchased. This should not be surprising if we write an equation relating the variables \(g\) and \(P\). Because the ratio of their values is constant, we can write
	\begin{equation*}\frac{P}{g}= k\end{equation*}
	where \(k\) is a constant. In this example, the constant \(k\) is \(2.40\), the price of gasoline per gallon. Solving for \(P\) in terms of \(g\), we have
	\begin{equation*}P = kg = 2.40g\end{equation*}
	which we recognize as the equation of a line through the origin.
