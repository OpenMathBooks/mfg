    The number of eggs (clutch size) that a bird lays varies greatly. Is there an optimal clutch size for birds of a given species, or does it depend on the individual bird? In 1980, biologists in Sweden conducted an experiment on magpies as follows: They reduced or enlarged the natural clutch size by adding or removing eggs from the nests. They then computed the average number of fledglings successfully raised by the parent birds in each case. The graph shows the results for magpies that initially laid 5, 6, 7, or 8 eggs.
