    The graph shows a cross section of Earth's surface along an eastâ€“west line from the coast of Africa through the Atlantic Ocean to South America. Both axes are scaled in kilometers. Use the figure to estimate the distances in this problem. (Source: Open University, 1998)
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-1704"><p id="p-2689">What is the highest land elevation shown in the figure? What is the lowest ocean depth shown? Give the horizontal coordinates of these two points, in kilometers west of the \(75\degree\)W longitude line.</p></li>
<li id="li-1705"><p id="p-2690">How deep is the Atlantic Ocean directly above the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? How deep is the ocean above the abyssal plain on either side of the ridge?</p></li>
<li id="li-1706"><p id="p-2691">What is the height of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge above the abyssal plain? What is the width of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge?</p></li>
<li id="li-1707"><p id="p-2692">Using your answers to part (c), calculate the slope from the abyssal plain to the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, rounded to five decimal places</p></li>
<li id="li-1708"><p id="p-2693">Estimate the slopes of the continental shelf, the continental slope, and the continental rise. Use the coordinates of the points indicated on the figure</p></li>
