    The period of a pendulum is the time it takes for the pendulum to complete one entire swing, from left to right and back again. The greater the length, \(L\), of the pendulum, the longer its period, \(T\). In fact, if \(L\) is measured in feet, then the period is given in seconds by
    \begin{equation*}T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{32}} \end{equation*}
