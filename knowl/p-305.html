<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>In a similar fashion, we can solve inequalities with a graph. Consider again the graph of \(y = 2x + 3\), shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-graph-to-solve3.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-graph-to-solve3" alt="Figure 1.71 " title="Figure 1.71 ">Figure 1.71</a>. We saw that \(x = 2\) is the solution of the equation \(2x + 3 = 7\). When we use \(x = 2\) as the input for the function \(f(x) = 2x + 3\), the output is \(y = 7\). Which input values for \(x\) produce output values greater than \(7\)? You can see in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-graph-to-solve3.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-graph-to-solve3" alt="Figure 1.71 " title="Figure 1.71 ">Figure 1.71</a> that \(x\)-values greater than \(2\) produce \(y\)-values greater than \(7\), because points on the graph with \(x\)-values greater than \(2\) have \(y\)-values greater than \(7\). Thus, the solutions of the inequality \(2x + 3 \gt 7\) are \(x\gt 2\). You can verify this result by solving the inequality algebraically.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="graphs-of-functions.html#p-305">in-context</a></span>
