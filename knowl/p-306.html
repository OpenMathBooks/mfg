    “String theory \(\ldots\) predicts that space has dimensions beyond the usual three. In three dimensions, the force of  as strong.” In three dimensions, the forcgravity quadruples as you halve the distance between two objects. But in nine dimensions, gravity would get \(256\) timese of gravity varies inversely with the square of distance. Write a formula for the force of gravity in nine dimensions.
