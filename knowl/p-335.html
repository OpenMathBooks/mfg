    <a knowl="./knowl/exercise-slope-any-points.html" knowl-id="xref-exercise-slope-any-points" alt="Exercise 1.4.19 " title="Exercise 1.4.19 ">Exercise 1.4.19</a> illustrates an important property of lines: They have constant slope. No matter which two points we use to calculate the slope, we will always get the same result. We will see later that lines are the only graphs that have this property. We can think of the slope as a scale factor that tells us how many units \(y\) increases (or decreases) for each unit of increase in \(x\). Compare the lines in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-slope-scale-factor.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-slope-scale-factor" alt="Figure 1.4.20 " title="Figure 1.4.20 ">Figure 1.4.20</a>

    Observe that a line with positive slope increases from left to right, and one with negative slope decreases. What sort of line has slope \(m = 0\)?
