        The Kukulcan Pyramid at Chichen Itza in Mexico was built around 800 A.D. It is 24 meters high, with a temple built on its top platform, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-Kukulcan-Pyramid.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-Kukulcan-Pyramid" alt="Figure 1.95 " title="Figure 1.95 ">FigureÂ 1.95</a>. The square base is 55 meters on each side, and the top platform is 19.5 meters on each side. Calculate the slope of the sides of the pyramid. Which pyramid is steeper, Kukulcan or the Great Pyramid?
