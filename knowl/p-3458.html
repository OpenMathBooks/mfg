    Compared to the graph of \(y = x^2\), the graph of \(f (x) = 2x^2\) is expanded, or stretched, vertically by a factor of \(2\). The \(y\)-coordinate of each point on the graph has been doubled, as you can see in the table of values, so each point on the graph of \(f\) is twice as far from the \(x\)-axis as its counterpart on the basic graph \(y = x^2\).
