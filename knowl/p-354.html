    As we saw in <a href="LinMod.html" alt="Section 1.1 Linear Models" title="Section 1.1 Linear Models">SectionÂ 1.1</a>, many linear models \(y = f (x)\) have equations of the form
    <div class="displaymath" id="me-92">\begin{equation*}f (x) = (\text{starting value}) + (\text{rate of change}) \cdot x\end{equation*}</div>
    The starting value, or the value of \(y\) at \(x = 0\), is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. Thus, we can write the equation of a line as
    <div class="displaymath" id="me-93">\begin{equation*}f (x) = b + mx\end{equation*}</div>
    where the constant term, \(b\), is the \(y\)-intercept of the line, and \(m\), the coefficient of \(x\), is the slope of the line. This form for the equation of a line is called the <em class="terminology">slope-intercept form</em>.
