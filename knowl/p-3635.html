                The graph begins just as the graph in part (b) does. The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-home-to-school.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-home-to-school" alt="Figure 2.84 " title="Figure 2.84 ">FigureÂ 2.84</a>c.
