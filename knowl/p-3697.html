<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>A weight is \(6.5\) feet above the floor, suspended from the ceiling by a spring. The weight is pulled down to \(5\) feet above the floor and released, rising past \(6.5\) feet in \(0.5\) second before attaining its maximum height of \(8\) feet. Neglecting the effects of friction, the height of the weight will continue to oscillate between its minimum and maximum height.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="chap2-rev-projects.html#p-3697">in-context</a></span>
