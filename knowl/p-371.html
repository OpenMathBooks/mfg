    We can find the equation for a line if we know its slope and \(y\)-intercept. What if we do not know the \(y\)-intercept, but instead know some other point on the line? There is only one line that passes through a given point and has a given slope. For example, we can graph the line of slope \(\frac{−3}{4}\) that passes through the point \((1, −4)\). </p><span class="incontext"><a href="linear-functions.html#p-371">in-context</a></span>
