    The models we have explored so far, namely, linear, exponential, logarithmic, and power, are monotonic functions, that is, always increasing or always decreasing on their domains. (Remember that we used power functions as models in the first quadrant only.) In this chapter, we investigate problems where the output variable may change from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa. The simplest sort of function that models this behavior is a quadratic function, one that involves the square of the variable.
