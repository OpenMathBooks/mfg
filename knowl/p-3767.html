    Ever since Gutenberg's invention of movable type in 1455, artists and printers have been interested in the design of pleasing and practical fonts. In 1525, Albrecht Durer published <span class="booktitle">On the Just Shaping of Letters</span>, which set forth a system of rules for the geometric construction of Roman capitals. The letters shown above are examples of Durer's font. Until the twentieth century, a ruler and compass were the only practical design tools, and consequently straight lines and circular arcs were the only geometric objects that could be accurately reproduced.
