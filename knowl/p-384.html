    We have spent most of this chapter analyzing models described by graphs or equations. To create a model, however, we often start with a quantity of data. Choosing an appropriate function for a model is a complicated process. In this section, we consider only linear models and explore methods for fitting a linear function to a collection of data points. First, we fit a line through two data points.
