<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The rate at which air temperature decreases with altitude is called the lapse rate. In the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere that extends from the Earthâ€™s surface to a height of about \(7\) miles, the lapse rate is about \(3.6\degree\)F for every \(1000\) feet.
