    A biologist isolates two strains of a particular virus and monitors the growth of each, starting with samples of \(0.01\) gram. Strain A increases by \(10\%\) in \(8\) hours and strain B increases by \(12\%\) in \(9\) hours.
    </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-225"><p id="p-394">How much did the sample of strain A weigh after \(8\) hours? What was its hourly growth factor?</p></li>
<li id="li-226"><p id="p-395">How much did the sample of strain B weigh after \(9\) hours? What was its hourly growth factor?</p></li>
<li id="li-227"><p id="p-396">Which strain of virus grows more rapidly?</p></li>
