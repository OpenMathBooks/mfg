	A quadratic equation in one variable always has two solutions. However, in some cases, the solutions may be equal. For example, the equation
	\(x^2 − 2x + 1 = 0\)
	can be solved by factoring as follows:
	\begin{align*}
	(x − 1)(x − 1) \amp = 0\amp\amp\text{Apply the zero-factor principle.}\\
	x − 1 =0 ~~\text{ or } ~~ x − 1 \amp= 0
	\end{align*}
	Both of these equations have solution \(1\). We say that \(1\) is a solution of <em class="terminology">multiplicity</em> two, meaning that it occurs twice as a solution of the quadratic equation.
