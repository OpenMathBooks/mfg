<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>World3 is a computer model developed by a team of researchers at MIT. The model tracks population growth, use of resources, land development, industrial investment, pollution, and many other variables that describe human impact on the planet. The figure below is taken from the researchers' book, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</em>.
