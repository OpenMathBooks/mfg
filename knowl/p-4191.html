	The local theater group sold tickets to its opening night performance for \(\$5\) and drew an audience of \(100\) people. The next night, the group reduced the ticket price by \(\$0.25\) and \(10\) more people attended; that is, \(110\) people bought tickets at \(\$4.75\) apiece. In fact, for each \(\$0.25\) reduction in ticket price, \(10\) additional tickets can be sold.
