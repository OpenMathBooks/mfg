		Etienne plans to open a coffee house, and he has \(\$7520\) to spend on furniture. A table costs \(\$460\), and a chair costs \(\$120\). Etienne will buy four chairs for each table. How many tables can he buy?
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-2339"><p id="p-4197">
				Let \(x\) represent the number of tables Etienne should buy, and let \(y\) represent the number of chairs. Write an equation about the cost of the furniture.
			</p></li>
<li id="li-2340"><p id="p-4198">
				Write a second equation about the number of tables and chairs.
			</p></li>
<li id="li-2341"><p id="p-4199">
				Graph both equations, solve the system, and answer the question in the problem. (Find the intercepts of the graphs to help you choose a window.)
			</p></li>
</ol>
