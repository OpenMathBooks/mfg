    The Bopp-Busch Tool and Die Company markets its products to individuals, to contractors, and to wholesale distributors. The company offers three different price structures for its toggle bolts. If you order \(20\) or fewer boxes, the price is \(\$2.50\) each. If you order more than \(20\) but no more than \(50\) boxes, the price is \(\$2.25\) each. If you order more than \(50\) boxes, the price is \($2.10\) each. State the domain and range of \(C(x)\), the cost of ordering \(x\) boxes of toggle bolts.
