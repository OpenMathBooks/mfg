<li id="li-2973">\(D = b^2 − 4ac = (−1)^2 − 4(1)(−3) = 13 \gt 0\). The equation has two real, unequal solutions. Because \(13\) is not a perfect square, the solutions will be irrational numbers, so the equation cannot be solved by factoring.
			</li>
<li id="li-2974">\(D = b^2 − 4ac = 1^2 − 4(2)(1) = −7 \lt 0\).
				 The equation has two complex solutions, which cannot be found by factoring.

<li id="li-2975">\(D = b^2 − 4ac = (−2)^2 − 4(1)(−3) = 16 \gt 0\)
				The equation has two real, unequal solutions. Because \(16 = 4^2\), the solutions are rational numbers and can be found by factoring.
