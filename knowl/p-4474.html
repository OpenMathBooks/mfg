	An <em class="terminology">exponential equation</em> is one in which the variable is part of an exponent. For example, the equation
	\begin{equation*}3^x = 81\end{equation*}
	is exponential. Many exponential equations can be solved by writing both sides of the equation as powers with the same base. To solve the above equation, we write
	\begin{equation*}3^x = 3^4\end{equation*}
	which is true if and only if \(x = 4\). In general, if two equivalent powers have the same base, then their exponents must be equal also, as long as the base is not \(0\) or \(\pm 1\).
