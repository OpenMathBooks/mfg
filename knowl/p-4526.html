	We can use the intersect feature of the graphing calculator to solve systems of quadratic equations. Consider the system
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		y \amp= (x + 1.1)^2\\
		y \amp = 7.825 − 2x − 2.5x^2
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
	We will graph these two equations in the standard window. The two intersection points are visible in the window, but we do not find their exact coordinates when we trace the graphs. Use the intersect command to locate one of the solutions, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-GC-quadratic-system2.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-GC-quadratic-system2" alt="Figure 6.79 " title="Figure 6.79 ">Figure 6.79</a>. You can check that the point \((0.9, 4)\) is an exact solution to the system by substituting \(x = 0.9\) and \(y = 4\) into each equation of the system. (The calculator is not always able to find the exact coordinates, but it usually gives a very good approximation.)
