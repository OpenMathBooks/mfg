<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Inga runs hot water into the bathtub until it is about half full. Because the water is too hot, she lets it sit for a while before getting into the tub. After several minutes of bathing, she gets out and drains the tub. Graph the water level in the bathtub as a function of time, from the moment Inga starts filling the tub until it is drained.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="chap2-summary.html#p-4536">in-context</a></span>
