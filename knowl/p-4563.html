		Many people think that the inequality signs in the solution should point in the same direction as the sign in the original problem, and hence would incorrectly write the solution to <a knowl="./knowl/example-quadratic-inequality2.html" knowl-id="xref-example-quadratic-inequality2" alt="Example 6.94 " title="Example 6.94 ">Example 6.94</a> as \(x \le −2\) or \(x \le 8\). However, you can see from the graph that this is incorrect. Remember that the graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola, not a straight line!
