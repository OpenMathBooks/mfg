		When estimating their travel time, pilots must take into account the prevailing winds. A tailwind adds to the plane's ground speed, while a headwind decreases the ground speed. Skyhigh Airlines is setting up a shuttle service from Dallas to Phoenix, a distance of \(800\) miles.
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-3017"><p id="p-4633">
				Express the time needed for a one-way trip, without wind, as a function of the speed of the plane.
			</p></li>
<li id="li-3018"><p id="p-4634">
				Suppose there is a prevailing wind of \(30\) miles per hour blowing from the west. Write expressions for the flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Dallas.
			</p></li>
<li id="li-3019"><p id="p-4635">
				Write an expression for the round-trip flying time, excluding stops, with a \(30\)-mile-per-hour wind from the west, as a function of the plane's speed. Simplify your expression.
