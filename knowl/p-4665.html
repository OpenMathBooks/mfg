				The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to \(15\) miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly \(15\) miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at \(x = 15\).
