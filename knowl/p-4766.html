	The <em class="terminology">demand function</em> gives the number of units of the product that consumers will buy in terms of the price per unit. The <em class="terminology">supply function</em> gives the number of units that the producer will supply in terms of the price per unit. The price at which the supply and demand are equal is called the <em class="terminology">equilibrium price</em>. This is the price at which the consumer and the producer agree to do business.
