		We first write the inequality with zero on one side: \(x^2 − 2x − 15 \le 0\). We would like to find points on the graph of \(y = x^2 − 2x − 15\) that have \(y\)-coordinates less than or equal to zero. A graph of the equation is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-quadratic-inequality.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-quadratic-inequality" alt="Figure 6.91 " title="Figure 6.91 ">Figure 6.91</a>. You can check that the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph are \(−3\) and \(5\). The points shown in red on the graph lie below the \(x\)-axis and have \(y \le 0\), so the \(x\)-coordinates of these points are the solutions of the inequality. All of these points have \(x\)-coordinates between \(−3\) and \(5\). Thus, the solution is \(−3\le x\le 5\), or in interval notation, \([−3, 5]\).
