    In <a href="functions.html" alt="Section 1.2 Functions" title="Section 1.2 Functions">SectionÂ 1.2</a>, we saw that for most functions, \(f (a + b)\) is not equal to \(f (a) + f (b)\). We may be able to find some values of \(a\) and \(b\) for which \(f (a + b) = f (a) + f (b)\) is true, but not for all values of \(a\) and \(b\). If there is even one value of \(a\) or \(b\) for which \(f (a + b)\) is not equal to \(f (a) + f (b)\), we cannot claim that \(f (a + b) = f (a) + f (b)\) for that function. For example, for the function \(f (x) = x^2\), if we choose \(a = 3\) and \(b = 4\), then
    \begin{align*}
f (3 + 4) \amp = f (7) = 7^2 = 49\\
\text{but }~ f (3) + f (4) \amp = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
\end{align*}
    so we have proved that \(f (a + b) \ne f (a) + f (b)\) for the squaring function. (In fact, we already knew this because \((a + b)^2 \ne a^2 + b^2\) as long as neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is \(0\).)
