    With the advent of computers, however, complex curves and surfaces, such as the smooth contours of modern cars, can be defined precisely and reproduced in metal or plastic. In fact, it was the French automobile engineer Pierre Bézier who in the 1960s developed a new design tool based on polynomials. <em class="terminology">Bézier curves</em> are widely used today in all fields of design, from technical plans and blueprints to the most creative artistic endeavors.
