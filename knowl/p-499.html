    An equation in two variables, such as y = 2x + 3, is said to be satisfied if the variables are replaced by a pair of numbers that make the statement true. The pair of numbers is called a <em class="terminology">solution</em> of the equation and is usually written as an ordered pair \((x, y)\). (The first number in the pair is the value of \(x\) and the second number is the value of \(y\).)
