<article class="paragraph"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Mathematics, as we all know, is the language of science, and fluency in algebraic skills has always been necessary for anyone aspiring to disciplines based on calculus. But in the information age, increasingly sophisticated mathematical methods are used in all fields of knowledge, from archaeology to zoology. Consequently, there is a new focus on the courses before calculus. The availability of calculators and computers allows students to tackle complex problems involving real data, but requires more attention to analysis and interpretation of results. All students, not just those headed for science and engineering, should develop a mathematical viewpoint, including critical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and estimation, in addition to computational skills. <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Modeling, Functions and Graphs</em> employs a variety of applications to motivate mathematical thinking.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#p-5">in-context</a></span>
