	A <em class="terminology">linear inequality</em> can be written in the form
	\begin{equation*}
		ax + by + c \le 0 ~~~\text{ or }~~~  ax + by + c \ge 0
	\end{equation*}
	The solutions consist of the line \(ax + by + c = 0\) and a <em class="terminology">half-plane</em> on one side of that line. We shade the half-plane to show that all its points are included in the solution set. If the inequality is strict, then the graph includes only the half-plane and not the line. In that case, we use a dashed line for the graph of the equation \(ax + by + c = 0\) to show that it is not part of the solution.
