	Carol can burn \(600\) calories per hour bicycling and \(400\) calories per hour swimming. She would like to lose \(5\) pounds, which is equivalent to \(16,000\) calories.
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-3259">
			Write an equation relating the number of hours of cycling, \(x\), and the number of hours swimming, \(y\), that Carol must spend to lose \(5\) pounds.
		</li>
<li id="li-3260">
			Write \(y\) as a function of \(x\), \(y = f (x)\). What does \(f (10)\) tell you?
		</li>
<li id="li-3261">
			Find the inverse function, \(x = g(y)\). What does \(g(10)\) tell you?
		</li>
