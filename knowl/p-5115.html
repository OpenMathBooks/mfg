<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
    Two businesswomen start a small company to produce saddle bags for bicycles. The number of saddle bags, \(q\), they can produce depends on the amount of money, \(m\), they invest and the number of hours of labor, \(w\), they employ, according to the Cobb-Douglas formula
    \begin{equation*}q= 0.6m^{1/4}w^{3/4} \end{equation*}
    where \(m\) is measured in thousands of dollars.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-3190"><p id="p-5116">If the businesswomen invest \(\$100,000\) and employ \(1600\) hours of labor in their first month of production, how many saddle bags can they expect to produce?</p></li>
<li id="li-3191"><p id="p-5117">With the same initial investment, how many hours of labor would they need in order to produce \(200\) saddle bags?</p></li>
</ol>
