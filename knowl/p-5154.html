    A company's monthly production, \(P\), depends on the capital, \(C\), the company has invested and the amount of labor, \(L\), available each month. The Cobb-Douglas model for production assumes that \(P\) varies jointly with \(C^a\) and \(L^b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive constants less than \(1\). The Aztech Chip Company invested \(625\) units of capital and hired \(256\) workers and produces \(8000\) computer chips each month.
