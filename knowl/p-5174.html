    Fell running is a popular sport in the hills, or fells, of the British Isles. Fell running records depend on the altitude gain over the course of the race as well as its length. The equivalent horizontal distance for a race of length \(x\) kilometers with an ascent of \(y\) kilometers is given by \(x + Ny\), where \(N\) is Naismith's number (see <a knowl="./knowl/Naismith.html" knowl-id="xref-Naismith" alt="Project 1.6 Naismith's rule" title="Project 1.6 Naismith's rule">Project 1.6</a>). The record times for women's races are approximated in minutes by \(t = 2.43(x + 9.5y)^{1.15}\), and men's times by \(t = 2.18(x + 8.0y)^{1.14}\). (Source: Scarf, 1998)
