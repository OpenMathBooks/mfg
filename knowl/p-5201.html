<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>To simplify the calculations, suppose that a pine tree is shaped like a tall circular cone and that as it grows, its height is always a constant multiple of its base radius, \(r\). Explain why the base radius of the tree is proportional to the square root of the area the tree covers. Write \(r\) as a power function of \(d\).</p><span class="incontext"><a href="chap3-rev-projects.html#p-5201">in-context</a></span>
