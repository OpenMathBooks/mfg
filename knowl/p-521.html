    Creating a good model for a situation often begins with deciding what kind of function to use. An appropriate model can depend on very qualitative considerations, such as the general shape of the graph. What sort of function has the right shape to describe the process we want to model? Should it be increasing or decreasing, or some combination of both? Is the slope constant or is it changing? In Examples 1 and 2, we investigate how the shape of a graph illustrates the nature of the process it models.
