	Recall that every point on the graph of an equation represents a solution to that equation. A solution to <!--Style me with CSS--><em>both</em> equations corresponds to a point on both graphs. Therefore, a solution to the system is a point where the two graphs intersect. From <a knowl="./knowl/fig-2x2-linear-system.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-2x2-linear-system" alt="Figure 8.1 " title="Figure 8.1 ">FigureÂ 8.1</a>, it appears that the intersection point is \((4, 6)\), so we expect that the values \(t=\alert{4}\) and \(r=\blert{6}\) form the solution to the system. We can check by verifying that these values satisfy <!--Style me with CSS--><em>both</em> equations in the system.
	\begin{align*}

			3(\alert{4}) + 6(\blert{6})\amp\stackrel{?}{=}48 \amp\amp\text{True}
		\\

			5(\alert{4}) + 2(\blert{6})\amp\stackrel{?}{=}32 \amp\amp\text{True}
		
\end{align*}
	Both equations are true, so we conclude that the average weight of a thrush is \(4\) ounces, and the average weight of a robin is \(6\) ounces.
