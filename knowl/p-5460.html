    <em class="terminology">Linear programming</em> is an application of linear systems developed in the 1940s to solve complex optimization problems during wartime operations. Today, linear programming is used in scheduling and allocation of resources, in shipping and telecommunications networks, and in the selection of stocks and bonds for portfolios. In 1980, the computer scientist Laszlo Lovasz said, “If one would take statistics about which mathematical problem is using up most of the computer time in the world, ... the answer would probably be linear programming.”
