		Laura is a finicky eater, and she dislikes most foods that are high in calcium. Her morning cereal satisfies some of her calcium requirements, but she needs an additional 500 milligrams of calcium, which she will get from a combination of broccoli, at 160 milligrams per serving, and zucchini, at 30 milligrams per serving. Draw a graph representing the possible combinations of broccoli and zucchini that fulfill Lauraâ€™s calcium requirements.
