	We are only allowed to choose points from the set of feasible solutions. Imagine the parallel lines representing different values of the objective function sweeping across the graph of the feasible solutions. The objective values increase as the lines sweep up across the graph. What is the last feasible solution the lines intersect before leaving the shaded region? If you study the preceding examples, perhaps you can see that the largest (and smallest) values of the objective function will occur at corner points of the set of feasible solutions. We have not proved this fact, but it is true.
