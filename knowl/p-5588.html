	Using the wrong type of equation to fit the data is a common error in making predictions. We know that the minute hand of a clock repeats its position every \(60\) minutes. The graph of the height of its tip oscillates up and down, repeating the same pattern over and over. We cannot describe such a graph using either a linear or a quadratic equation. The graph of the height is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-quadratic-fit-of-periodic.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-quadratic-fit-of-periodic" alt="Figure 6.122 " title="Figure 6.122 ">FigureÂ 6.122</a>, along with the graph of our quadratic regression equation. You can see that the regression equation fits the actual curve only on a small interval.
