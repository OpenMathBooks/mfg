				We know that the minimum cost will occur at one of the vertex points, which are labeled in the figure. The coordinates of \(P\) and \(R\) are easy to see. To find the coordinates of \(Q\), we notice that it is the intersection of the lines \(2x + 3y = 12\) and \(x + 3y = 9\). Thus, we must solve the system
				\begin{align*}
2x + 3y \amp= 12\\
x + 3y \amp = 9
\end{align*}
				Subtracting the second equation from the first, we find that \(x=3\). Substituting this value into either of the original two equations, we find that \(y=2\). Thus the point \(Q\) has coordinates \((3, 2)\).
