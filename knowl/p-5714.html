	Despite the differences in the central portions of the two graphs, they exhibit similar <!--Style me with CSS--><em>long-term</em> behavior. For very large and very small values of \(x\), both graphs look like the power function \(y = x^3\). The \(y\)-values increase from \(-\infty\) toward zero in the third quadrant, and they increase from zero toward \(+\infty\) in the first quadrant. Or we might say that the graphs start at the lower left and extend to the upper right. All cubic polynomials display this behavior when their lead coefficients (the coefficient of the \(x^3\) term) are positive.
