    In a famous experiment in the 1960s, an elephant was given LSD. The dose was determined from a previous experiment in which a \(2.6\)-kg cat was given \(0.26\) gram of LSD. Because the elephant weighed \(2970\) kg, the experimenters used a direct proportion to calculate the dose for the elephant:
    <div class="displaymath" id="me-36">\begin{equation*}\frac{0.26 \text{ g}}{2.6 \text{ kg}}= \frac{x \text{ g}}{2970 \text{ kg}}\end{equation*}</div>
    and arrived at the figure \(297\) g of LSD. Unfortunately, the elephant did not survive the experiment.
