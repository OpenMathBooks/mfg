    For the functions we have studied so far, there are only two operations we must avoid when finding the domain: division by zero and taking the square root of a negative number. Many common functions have as their domain the entire set of real numbers. In particular, a linear function \(f (x) = b + mx\) can be evaluated at any real number value of \(x\), so its domain is the set of all real numbers. This set is represented in interval notation as \((âˆ’\infty, \infty)\).
