    If the domain of a function is not given as part of its definition, we assume that the domain is as large as possible. We include in the domain all \(x\)-values that make sense when substituted into the function's formula. For example, the domain of \(f (x) =\sqrt{9 − x^2}\) is the interval \([−3, 3]\), because \(x\)-values less than \(−3\) or greater than \(3\) result in square roots of negative numbers. You may recognize the graph of \(f\) as the upper half of the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 9\), as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-semicircle.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-semicircle" alt="Figure 2.135 " title="Figure 2.135 ">Figure 2.135</a>
