		If we scroll down the table, we find that this equation predicts a height of approximately \(4.08\) feet at time \(40\) minutes. (See figure c.) This is a preposterous estimate! The position of the minute hand at \(40\) minutes after noon should be the same as it was exactly one hour earlier (at 20 minutes before noon), when it was \(7.50\) feet.
