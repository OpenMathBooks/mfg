    We next turn our attention to a large and useful family of functions called <em class="terminology">power functions</em>. This family includes transformations of several of the basic functions, such as
    \begin{equation*}
        F(d) = \frac{k}{d^2} ~\text{ and } ~ S(T ) = 20.06\sqrt{T}
    \end{equation*}
    The first function gives the gravitational force, \(F\), exerted by the sun on an object at a distance, \(d\). The second function gives the speed of sound, \(S\), in terms of the air temperature, \(T\). By extending our definition of exponent to include negative numbers and fractions, we will be able to express such functions in the form \(f (x) = kx^n\). Here is an example of a power function with a fractional exponent.
