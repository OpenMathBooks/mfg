	The second table, <a knowl="./knowl/table-population.html" knowl-id="xref-table-population" alt="Table 3.1.2 " title="Table 3.1.2 ">Table 3.1.2</a>, shows the population of a small town as a function of the town’s age. The ratio number of people number of years gives the average rate of growth of the population in people per year. You can see that this ratio is not constant; in fact, it increases as time goes on. Thus, the population of the town is not proportional to its age.
