	The fact that the constant term is zero in a direct variation is significant: If we double the value of \(x\), then the value of \(y\) will double also. In fact, increasing \(x\) by any factor causes \(y\) to increase by the same factor. For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/table-gasoline.html" knowl-id="xref-table-gasoline" alt="Table 3.1.1 " title="Table 3.1.1 ">Table 3.1.1</a> doubling the number of gallons of gas purchased, say, from \(4\) gallons to \(8\) gallons or from \(6\) gallons to \(12\) gallons, causes the total price to double also. Or, consider investing \(\$800\) for one year at \(7\)% simple interest, as in <a knowl="./knowl/example-circumference-and-simple-interest.html" knowl-id="xref-example-circumference-and-simple-interest" alt="Example 3.1.4 " title="Example 3.1.4 ">Example 3.1.4</a>b. The interest earned is
	\begin{equation*}I = 0.07(800) = \$56\end{equation*}
	If we increase the investment by a factor of \(1.6\) to \(1.6 (800)\), or \(\$1280\), the interest will be 
	\begin{equation*}I = 0.07(1280) = \$89.60\end{equation*}
	You can check that multiplying the original interest of \(\$56\) by a factor of \(1.6\) does give the same figure for the new interest, \(\$89.60\).
