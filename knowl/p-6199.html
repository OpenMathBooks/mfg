	We can choose <!--Style me with CSS--><em>any</em> point for the test point as long as it does not lie on the boundary line. We chose \((0, 0)\) in Example 2 because the coordinates are easy to substitute into the inequality. If the test point <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> a solution to the inequality, then the half-plane including that point should be shaded. If the test point is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> a solution to the inequality, then the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>other</em> half-plane should be shaded. For example, suppose we had chosen (5, 0) as the test point in <a knowl="./knowl/example-linear-inequality-test-point.html" knowl-id="xref-example-linear-inequality-test-point" alt="Example 8.64 " title="Example 8.64 ">Example 8.64</a>. When we substitute its coordinates into the inequality, we find
	\begin{equation*}
		3(\alert{5}) − 2(\blert{0}) \lt 6
	\end{equation*}
	which is a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>false</em> statement. This tells us that \((5, 0)\) is not a solution to the inequality, so the solutions must lie on the other side of the boundary line. Using (5, 0) as the test point gives us the same solutions we found in <a knowl="./knowl/example-linear-inequality-test-point.html" knowl-id="xref-example-linear-inequality-test-point" alt="Example 8.64 " title="Example 8.64 ">Example 8.64</a>.
