	The intensity of electromagnetic radiation, such as light or radio waves, varies inversely with the square of the distance from its source. Radio station KPCC broadcasts a signal that is measured at \(0.016\) watt per square meter by a receiver \(1\) kilometer away.
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-21">Write a formula that gives signal strength as a function of distance.</li>
<li id="li-22">If you live \(5\) kilometers from the station, what is the strength of the signal you will receive?</li>
</ol>
