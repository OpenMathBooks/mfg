	Recall that if \(y\) varies directly with \(x\), then doubling \(x\) causes \(y\) to double also. But is the area of a \(16\)-inch circular pizza double the area of an \(8\)-inch pizza? If you double the dimensions of a model of a skyscraper, will its weight double also? You probably know that the answer to both of these questions is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>No</em>. The area of a circle is proportional to the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>square</em> of its radius, and the volume (and hence the weight) of an object is proportional to the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>cube</em> of its linear dimension. Variation with a power of \(x\) produces a different scaling effect.
