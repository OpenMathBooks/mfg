	In general, if \(y\) varies directly with a power of \(x\), that is, if \(y = kx^n\), then doubling the value of \(x\) causes \(y\) to increase by a factor of \(2^n\). In fact, if we multiply \(x\) by any positive number \(c\), then
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		y_\text{new} \amp =k(cx)^n
		\amp =c^n(kx^n) = c^n(y_\text{old})
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
	so the value of \(y\) is multiplied by \(c^n\). We will call \(n\) the <em class="terminology">scaling exponent</em>, and you will often see variation described in terms of scaling. For example, we might say that "the area of a circle scales as the square of its radius."" (In many applications, the power \(n\) is called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>scale factor</em>, even though it is not a factor but an exponent.)
