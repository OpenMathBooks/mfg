        We know that \(w = 225\), and we would like to know the value of \(h\). We substitute the value for \(w\) into our equation and then solve for \(h\).
        \begin{align*}
w \amp= 6h\amp\amp \text{Substitute 225 for }w.\\
\alert{225} \amp= 6h\amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by } 6.\\
\frac{225}{\alert{6}}\amp = \frac{6h}{\alert{6}}\amp\amp \text{Simplify.}\\
375.5\amp = h
\end{align*}
        Loren must work \(37.5\) hours in order to earn \(\$225\). In reality, Loren will probably have to work for \(38\) hours, because most employers do not pay for portions of an hour's work. Thus, Loren needs to work for \(38\) hours.
