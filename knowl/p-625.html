    Many endangered species have fewer than \(1000\) individuals left. To preserve the species, captive breeding programs must maintain a certain effective population, \(N\), given by
    \begin{equation*}N=\frac{4FM}{F+M} \end{equation*}
    where \(F\) is the number of breeding females and \(M\) the number of breeding males. (Source: Chapman and Reiss, 1992)
