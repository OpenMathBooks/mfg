    We can see that the \(y\)-intercept of each line is given by the constant term, \(b\). By examining the table of values, we can also see why the coefficient of \(x\)gives the slope of the line: 
    For \(f (x)\), each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) decreases by \(3\) units. For \(g(x)\), each time \(x\) increases by \(1\) unit, \(y\) increases by \(2\) units. For each graph, the coefficient of \(x\) is a scale factor that tells us how many units \(y\) changes for \(1\) unit increase in \(x\). But that is exactly what the slope tells us about a line.
