    Many properties relating to the growth of plants and animals can be described by power functions of their mass. The study of the relationship between the growth rates of different parts of an organism, or of organisms of similar type, is called <em class="terminology">allometry</em>. An equation of the form
    \begin{equation*}\text{variable} = k(\text{mass})^p\end{equation*}
    used to describe such a relationship is called an <em class="terminology">allometric equation</em>.
