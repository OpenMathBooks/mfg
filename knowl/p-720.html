    On the other hand, every positive number has two even roots that are real numbers. For example, both \(3\) and \(−3\) are square roots of \(9\). The symbol \(\sqrt{9}\) refers only to the positive, or principal root, of \(9\). If we want to refer to the negative square root of \(9\), we must write \(−\sqrt{9} = −3\). Similarly, both \(2\) and \(−2\) are fourth roots of \(16\), because \(2^4 = 16\) and \((−2)^4 = 16\). However, the symbol \(\sqrt[4]{16}\) refers to the principal, or positive, fourth root only. Thus,
    \begin{equation*}\sqrt[4]{16} = 2 ~~ \text{ and } ~~ −\sqrt[4]{16} = −2\end{equation*}
