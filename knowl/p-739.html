    According to the third law of exponents, when we raise a power to another power, we multiply the exponents together. In particular, if the two exponents are reciprocals, then their product is \(1\). For example,
    \begin{equation*}\left(x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2} = x^{(2/3) (3/2)} = x^1 = x\end{equation*}
    This observation can help us to solve equations involving fractional exponents. For instance, to solve the equation
    \begin{equation*}x^{2/3} = 4\end{equation*}
    we raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal power, \(3/2\). This gives us
    \begin{align*}
    \left(x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2} \amp = 4^{3/2} \\
    x \amp = 8
    \end{align*}
    The solution is \(8\).
