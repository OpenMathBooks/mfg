    Thus, we can solve an equation where one side is an nth root of x by raising both sides of the equation to the nth power. We must be careful when raising both sides of an equation to an even power, since extraneous solutions may be introduced. However, because most applications of power functions deal with positive domains only, they do not usually involve extraneous solutions.
