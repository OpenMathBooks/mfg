    So far, we have studied functions that relate values of an output variable to values of a single input variable. But it is not uncommon for an output variable to depend on two or more inputs. Many familiar formulas describe functions of several variables. For example, the perimeter of a rectangle depends on its length and width. The volume of a cylinder depends on its radius and height. The distance you travel depends on your speed and the time you spent traveling. Each of these formulas can be written with function notation.
    \begin{align*}
    \amp P = f (l,w) = 2l + 2w \amp\amp \text{Perimeter is a function of length and width.}\\
    \amp V = f (r, h) = Ï€r 2h \amp\amp \text{Volume is a function of radius and height.}\\
    \amp d = f (r, t) = rt \amp\amp \text{Distance is a function of rate and time.}
    \end{align*}
