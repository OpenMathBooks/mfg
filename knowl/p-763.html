<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
    The period of a satellite orbiting the Earth varies directly with the radius of the orbit and inversely with the speed of the satellite.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-590">Write a formula for the period, \(T\), as a function of orbital radius, \(r\), and velocity, \(v\).</li>
<li id="li-591">GPS satellites orbit at an altitude of \(20,200\) kilometers and a speed of \(233\) kilometers per second. The period of a GPS satellite is \(11\) hours and \(58\) minutes. Find the constant of variation in your formula for \(T\). (The radius of the Earth is \(6360\) km.)</li>
<li id="li-592">Satellites in polar orbits are used to measure ozone concentrations in the atmosphere. They orbit at an altitude of \(300\) km and have a period of \(90\) minutes. What is the speed of a satellite in polar orbit?</li>
<li id="li-593">Graph \(T\) as a function of \(v\) for \(r = 5000\), \(r = 10,000\), \(r = 20,000\), and \(r = 30,000\).</li>
