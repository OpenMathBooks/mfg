<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>In all our work with functions and modeling we employ the “Rule of Four,” that all
problems should be considered using algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal methods.
It is the connections between these approaches that we have endeavored to establish in this course. At this level it is crucial that students learn to write an algebraic expression from a verbal description, recognize trends in a table of data, and
extract and interpret information from the graph of a function.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#p-8">in-context</a></span>
