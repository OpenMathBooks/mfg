    A solar energy company sold $\(80,000\) worth of solar collectors last year, its first year of operation. This year its sales rose to $\(88,000\), an increase of \(10\)%. The marketing department must estimate its projected sales for the next \(3\) years.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-654">
            If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow linearly, what should it expect the sales total to be next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next \(3\) years, assuming that sales will grow linearly.
        </li>
<li id="li-655">
            If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow exponentially, what should it expect the sales total to be next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next \(3\) years, assuming that sales will grow exponentially.
        </li>
</ol>
