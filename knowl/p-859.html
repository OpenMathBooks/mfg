	Suppose that a colony of bacteria doubles in size every day. If the colony starts with \(50\) bacteria, how long will it be before there are \(800\) bacteria? We answered questions of this type in <a href="Exponential-Functions.html" alt="Section 4.2 Exponential Functions" title="Section 4.2 Exponential Functions">SectionÂ 4.2</a> by writing and solving an exponential equation. The function
	\begin{equation*}P(t) = 50 \cdot 2^t\end{equation*}
	gives the number of bacteria present on day \(t\), so we must solve the equation
	\begin{equation*}800 = 50 \cdot 2^t\end{equation*}
	Dividing both sides by 50 yields
	\begin{equation*}16 = 2^t\end{equation*}
	The solution of this equation is the answer to the following question: To what power must we raise \(2\) in order to get \(16\)?
