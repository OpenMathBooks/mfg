	We use logarithms to solve exponential equations, just as we use square roots to solve quadratic equations. Consider the two equations
	\begin{equation*}x^2 = 25 ~ \text{ and } ~ 2^x = 8\end{equation*}
	We solve the first equation by taking a square root, and we solve the second equation by computing a logarithm:
	\begin{equation*}x = \pm\sqrt{25} = \pm 5 ~ \text{ and } ~ x = \log_{2}{8} = 3\end{equation*}
	The operation of taking a base \(b\) logarithm is the inverse operation for raising the base \(b\) to a power, just as extracting square roots is the inverse of squaring a number.
