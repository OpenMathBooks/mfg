<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>All the models in these examples have equations with a similar form:  \begin{equation*}y=\text{(starting value)}+\text{(rate of change)}\cdot x\end{equation*}
(We'll talk more about rate of change in Section 1.4.)  Their graphs were all portions of straight lines.  For this reason such equations are called  <em class="terminology">linear equations</em>.  The order of the terms in the equation does not matter.  For example, the equation in Example 1, \begin{equation*}C=5+3t\end{equation*} can be written equivalently as \begin{equation*}-3t+C=5\end{equation*} and the equation in Example 3, \begin{equation*}P=92,000+4700t\end{equation*} can be written as \begin{equation*}-4700+P=92,000\end{equation*} 
This form of a linear equation, \begin{equation*}Ax+By=C\end{equation*} is called the <em class="terminology">general form</em>.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="LinMod.html#p-88">in-context</a></span>
