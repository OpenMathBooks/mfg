<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>No tool for conveying information about a system is more powerful than a graph. Yet many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more
global view. By taking advantage of graphing calculators, we examine a large number of examples and study them in more detail than is possible when every graph is plotted by hand. We can consider more realistic models in which calculations by more traditional methods are difficult or impossible.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#p-9">in-context</a></span>
