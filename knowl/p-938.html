	The amount of money in an account that earns interest compounded annually grows exponentially according to the formula
	\begin{equation*}A(t) = P(1 + r )^t\end{equation*}
	(See <a href="Exponential-Growth-and-Decay.html" alt="Section 4.1 Exponential Growth and Decay" title="Section 4.1 Exponential Growth and Decay">SectionÂ 4.1</a> to review compound interest.) Many accounts compound interest more frequently than once a year. If the interest is compounded \(n\) times per year, then in \(t\) years there will be \(nt\) compounding periods, and in each period the account earns interest at a rate of \(\frac{r}{n}\). The amount accumulated is given by a generalization of our earlier formula.
