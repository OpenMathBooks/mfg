	The number of earthquakes that occur worldwide is a decreasing exponential function of their magnitude on the Richter scale. Between 2000 and 2005, there were \(7480\) earthquakes of magnitude \(5\) and \(793\) earthquakes of magnitude \(6\). (Source: National Earthquake Information Center, U.S. Geological Survey)
