	In <a knowl="./knowl/example-doubling-time.html" knowl-id="xref-example-doubling-time" alt="Example 4.5.7 " title="Example 4.5.7 ">ExampleÂ 4.5.7</a>, it took the population \(35\) years to double. Notice that the calculations in parts (a) and (b) are identical after the first step. In fact, we can start at any point, and it will take the population \(35\) years to double. We say that \(35\) years is the doubling time for this population. In the Homework problems, you will show that any increasing exponential function has a constant doubling time.
