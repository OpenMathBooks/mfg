	For the function \(M = f (L)\), the input value is the amount of the loan, and the output is the mortgage payment. However, when you are shopping for a house, you may think of the mortgage payment as the input variable: If you can afford a certain monthly mortgage payment, how large a loan can you finance? Now the mortgage payment is the input value, and the loan amount is the output. By interchanging the inputs and outputs, we define a new function, \(L = g(M)\), shown in <a knowl="./knowl/table-mortgage-inv.html" knowl-id="xref-table-mortgage-inv" alt="Table 5.1.2 " title="Table 5.1.2 ">TableÂ 5.1.2</a>.
