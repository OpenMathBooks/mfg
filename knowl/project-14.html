    The tone produced by a vibrating string depends on the frequency of the vibration. The frequency in turn depends on the length of the string, its weight, and its tension. In 1636, Marin Mersenne quantified these relationships as follows. The frequency, \(f\), of the vibration is
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li id="li-3243"><p id="p-5184">inversely proportional to the string's length, \(L\),</p></li>
<li id="li-3244"><p id="p-5185">directly proportional to the square root of the stringâ€™s tension, \(T\), and</p></li>
<li id="li-3245"><p id="p-5186">inversely proportional to the square root of the string's weight per unit length, \(w\). (Source: Berg and Stork, 1982)</p></li>
</ol>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-3246"><p id="p-5187">Write a formula for \(f\) that summarizes Mersenne's laws.</p></li>
<li id="li-3247"><p id="p-5188">Sketch a graph of \(f\) as a function of \(L\), assuming that \(T\) and \(w\) are constant. (You do not have enough information to put scales on the axes, but you can show the shape of the graph.)</p></li>
<li id="li-3248"><p id="p-5189">On a piano, the frequency of the highest note is about \(4200\) hertz. This frequency is \(150\) times the frequency of the lowest note, at about \(28\) hertz. Ideally, only the lengths of the strings should change, so that all the notes have the same tonal quality. If the string for the highest note is \(5\) centimeters long, how long should the string for the lowest note be?</p></li>

<li id="li-3250"><p id="p-5191">Sketch a graph of \(f\) as a function of \(w\), assuming that \(L\) and \(T\) are constant.</p></li>
<li id="li-3251"><p id="p-5192">The tension of all the strings in a piano should be about the same to avoid warping the frame. Suggest another way to produce a lower note. (Hint: Look at a piano's strings.)</p></li>
<li id="li-3252"><p id="p-5193">The longest string on the piano in part (c) is \(133.5\) cm long. How much heavier (per unit length) is the longest string than the shortest string?</p></li>
