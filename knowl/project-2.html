Halley's comet which orbits the sun every \(76\) years, was first observed in 240 B.C. Its orbit is highly elliptical, so that its closest approach to the Sun (<em class="terminology">perihelion</em>) is only \(0.587\) AU, while at its greatest distance (<em class="terminology">aphelion</em>) the comet is \(34.39\) AU from the Sun. (An AU, or astronomical unit, is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, \(1.5\times 10^8\) kilometers.)

<li id="li-1379"><p id="p-2101">The gravitational force (in newtons) exerted by the Sun on its satellites is inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the satellite in meters. The constant of variation is \(Gm_1 m_2\), where \(m_1 = 1.99\times 1030\) kilograms is the mass of the Sun, \(m_2\) is the mass of the satellite, and \(G = 6.67\times 10^{âˆ’11}\) is the gravitational constant. Write a formula for the force, \(F\), exerted by the sun on Halley's comet at a distance of \(d\) meters.</p></li>
