<p id="p-1847">The stopping distance, \(s\text{,}\) for a car traveling at speed \(v\) meters per second is given (in meters) by
\begin{equation*}
s=sT+\frac{v^2}{2a} 
\end{equation*}
where \(T\) is the reaction time of the driver and \(a\) is the average deceleration as the car brakes. Suppose that all the cars on a crowded motorway maintain the appropriate spacing determined by the stopping distance for their speed. What speed allows the maximum flow of cars along the road per unit time? Using the formula \(\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}\text{,}\) we see that the time interval, \(t\text{,}\) between cars is
\begin{equation*}
t=\frac{s}{v}+\frac{L}{v} 
\end{equation*}
where \(L\) is the length of the car. To achieve the maximum flow of cars, we would like \(t\) to be as small as possible. (Source: Bolton, 1974) </p>
