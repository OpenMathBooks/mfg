			Reading from the timeline, the Earth was formed between \(10^3\) and \(10^4\), or between \(1000\) and \(10,000\) million years ago. We estimate that Earth formed \(5000\) million years ago.

			The extinction of the dinosaurs is plotted between \(10^1\) and \(10^2\), or between \(10\) and \(100\) million years ago. Because the point is closer to \(10^2\), we estimate their extinction at \(70\) million years ago.
		</li>
<li id="li-920">
			The last ice age is plotted just after \(10^−2\), or \(0.01\) million years ago. One-hundredth of a million is \(10,000\), so we estimate that the ice age occurred a little more than \(10,000\) years ago.
		</li>
<li id="li-921">
			The Crusades occurred about \(10^{−3}\), or about \(0.001\) million years ago. One-thousandth of a million is \(1000\), so the Crusades occurred about \(1000\) years ago, or about \(1000\) A.D.
