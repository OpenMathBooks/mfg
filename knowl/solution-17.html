    Graph (a) represents a function, because it passes the vertical line test. Graph (b) is not the graph of a function, because the vertical line at (for example) \(x = 1\) intersects the graph at two points. For graph (c), notice the break in the curve at \(x = 2\): The solid dot at \((2, 1)\) is the only point on the graph with \(x = 2\); the open circle at \((2, 3)\) indicates that \((2, 3)\) is not a point on the graph. Thus, graph (c) is a function, with \(f(2) = 1\).
