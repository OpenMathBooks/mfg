		We enter the time data under \(L_1\) and the height data under \(L_2\). Then we calculate and store the quadratic regression equation in \(Y_1\), as we did in <a knowl="./knowl/example-GC-quadratic-fit.html" knowl-id="xref-example-GC-quadratic-fit" alt="Example 6.116 " title="Example 6.116 ">Example 6.116</a>. The regression equation is
		\begin{equation*}y = −0.00297x2 + 0x + 8.834\end{equation*}
		From either the graph of the regression equation or from the table (see figure below), we can see that the fit is not perfect, although the curve certainly fits the data better than any straight line could.

		If we scroll down the table, we find that this equation predicts a height of approximately \(4.08\) feet at time \(40\) minutes. (See figure c.) This is a preposterous estimate! The position of the minute hand at \(40\) minutes after noon should be the same as it was exactly one hour earlier (at 20 minutes before noon), when it was \(7.50\) feet.
