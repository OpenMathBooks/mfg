<li id="li-537">The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-home-to-school.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-home-to-school" alt="Figure 2.84 " title="Figure 2.84 ">Figure 2.84</a>a. It begins at the origin because at the instant that Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when t = 0, y = 0.) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrest’s walking speed.

<li id="li-538">The graph begins just as the graph in part (a) does. But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-home-to-school.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-home-to-school" alt="Figure 2.84 " title="Figure 2.84 ">Figure 2.84</a>b. The line has slope \(0\) because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is \(0\).

<li id="li-539">
                The graph begins just as the graph in part (b) does. The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-home-to-school.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-home-to-school" alt="Figure 2.84 " title="Figure 2.84 ">Figure 2.84</a>c.
