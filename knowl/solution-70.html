<li id="li-383">From the table, we see that articles of any weight up to \(1\) ounce require $0.47 postage. This means that for all \(w\)-values greater than \(0\) but less than or equal to \(1\), the \(p\)-value is \(0.47\). Thus, the graph of \(p = g(w)\) between \(w = 0\) and \(w = 1\) looks like a small piece of the horizontal line \(p = 0.47\). Similarly, for all \(w\)-values greater than \(1\) but less than or equal to \(2\), the \(p\)-value is \(0.68\), so the graph on this interval looks like a small piece of the line \(p = 0.68\). Continue in this way to obtain the graph shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-postage-2016.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-postage-2016" alt="Figure 2.6.11 " title="Figure 2.6.11 ">FigureÂ 2.6.11</a>.
    <figure class="figure-like" id="fig-postage-2016"><object type="image/svg+xml" style="width:80%; margin:auto; display:block;" data="images/fig-postage-2016.svg" alt=""><p style="margin:auto">&lt;&lt;SVG image is unavailable, or your browser cannot render it&gt;&gt;</p></object><figcaption><span class="heading">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">2.6.11</span></figcaption></figure>
    The open circles at the left endpoint of each horizontal segment indicate that that point is not included in the graph; the closed circles are points on the graph. For instance, if \(w = 3\), the postage, \(p\), is $0.89, not $1.10. Consequently, the point \((3, 0.89)\) is part of the graph of \(g\), but the point \((3, 1.10)\) is not.
    </li>
<li id="li-384">Postage rates are given for all weights greater than \(0\) ounces up to and including \(7\) ounces, so the domain of the function is the half-open interval \((0, 7]\). (The domain is an interval because there is a point on the graph for every \(w\)-value from \(0\) to \(7\).) The range of the function is not an interval, however, because the possible values for \(p\) do not include all the real numbers between \(0.3\) and \(1.75\). The range is the set of discrete values \(0.47\), \(0.68\), \(0.89\), \(1.10\), \(1.31\), \(1.52\), and \(1.73\).</li>
