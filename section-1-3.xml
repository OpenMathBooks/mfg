<title>Graphs of Functions</title>
<subsection><title>Reading Function Values from a Graph</title>   
<p>The graph in <xref ref="fig-DJIA" autoname="yes"/>  shows the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (the average value of the stock prices of 500 major companies) during the stock market correction of October 1987. The Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is given as a function of time during the 8 days from October 15 to October 22; that is, <m>f(t)</m> is the DJIA recorded at noon on day <m>t</m>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-DJIA"><image source="images/fig-DJIA" alt="Dow Jones Industrial Averge"  width="80%"  /><caption></caption></figure>
<p>The values of the input variable, time, are displayed on the horizontal axis, and the values of the output variable, DJIA, are displayed on the vertical axis. There is no formula that gives the DJIA for a particular day; but it is still a function, defined by its graph. The value of <m>f(t)</m> is specified by the vertical coordinate of the point with the given t-coordinate.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-DJIA">
    <ol label="*a*">
        <li>The coordinates of point <m>P</m> in <xref ref="fig-DJIA" autoname="yes"/> are <m>(15, 2412)</m>. What do the coordinates tell you about the function <m>f</m>?</li>
        <li>If the DJIA was 1726 at noon on October 20, what can you say about the graph of <m>f</m>?</li>
    </ol>
<solution>
    <ol label="*a*">
        <li>The coordinates of point P tell us that <m>f(15) = 2412</m>, so the DJIA was 2412 at noon on October 15.</li>
        <li>We can say that <m>f(20) = 1726</m>, so the point <m>(20, 1726)</m> lies on the graph of <m>f</m>. This point is labeled <m>Q</m> in <xref ref="fig-DJIA" autoname="yes"/>.</li>
    </ol>
</solution>
</example>

<p>Thus, the coordinates of each point on the graph of the function represent a pair of corresponding
values of the two variables. In general, we can make the following statement.</p>

<assemblage><title>Graph of a Function</title>
<p>The point <m>(a, b)</m> lies on the graph of the function <m>f</m> if and only if <m>f(a)=b</m>.

       The water level in Lake Huron alters unpredictably over time. The graph in <xref ref="fig-Lake-Huron" autoname="yes"/> gives the average water level, <m>L(t)</m>, in meters in the year <m>t</m> over a 20-year period. (Source: The Canadian Hydrographic Service)

    Another way of describing how a graph depicts a function is as follows:
</p>

<assemblage><title>Functions and Coordinates</title>
<p>
    Each point on the graph of the function <m>f</m> has coordinates <m>(x, f (x))</m> for some value of <m>x</m>.
</p>
</assemblage>

<example xml:id="example-function-graph">
    <p><xref ref="fig-function" autoname="yes"/> shows the graph of a function <m>g</m>.
    <ol label="*a*">
        <li>Find <m>g(−2)</m> and <m>g(5)</m>.</li>
        <li>For what value(s) of <m>t</m> is <m>g(t) = −2</m>?</li>
        <li>What is the largest, or maximum, value of <m>g(t)</m>? For what value of <m>t</m> does the function take on its maximum value?</li>
        <li>On what intervals is <m>g</m> increasing?</li>
    </ol></p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-function"><image source="images/fig-function" alt="graph of a function"  width="60%"  /><caption></caption></figure>

<solution>
    <ol label="*a*">
        <li>To find <m>g(−2)</m>, we look for the point with <m>t</m>-coordinate <m>−2</m>. The point <m>(−2, 0)</m> lies on the graph of <m>g</m>, so <m>g(−2) = 0</m>. Similarly, the point <m>(5, 1)</m> lies on the graph, so <m>g(5) = 1</m>.</li>
        <li>We look for points on the graph with <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>−2</m>. Because the points <m>(−5, −2)</m>, <m>(−3, −2)</m>, and <m>(3, −2)</m> lie on the graph, we know that <m>g(−5) = −2</m>, <m>g(−3) = −2</m>, and <m>g(3) = −2</m>. Thus, the <m>t</m>-values we want are <m>−5</m>, <m>−3</m>, and <m>3</m>.</li>
        <li>The highest point on the graph is <m>(1, 4)</m>, so the largest <m>y</m>-value is <m>4</m>. Thus, the maximum value of <m>g(t)</m> is <m>4</m>, and it occurs when <m>t = 1</m>.</li>
        <li>A graph is increasing if the <m>y</m>-values get larger as we read from left to right. The graph of <m>g</m> is increasing for <m>t</m>-values between <m>−4</m> and <m>1</m>, and between <m>3</m> and <m>5</m>. Thus, <m>g</m> is increasing on the intervals <m>(−4, 1)</m> and <m>(3, 5)</m>.</li>

    <p>We can use the <c>TRACE</c> feature of the calculator to find the coordinates of points on a graph. For example, graph the equation <m>y = −2.6x − 5.4</m> in the window</p>

    <p>Press <c>TRACE</c>, and a “bug” begins flashing on the display. The coordinates of the bug appear at the bottom of the display, as shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-trace" autoname="yes"/>. Use the left and right arrows to move the bug along the graph. You can check that the coordinates of the point <m>(2, −10.6)</m> do satisfy the equation <m>y = −2.6x − 5.4</m>.</p>
    <p>The points identified by the Trace bug depend on the window settings and on the type of calculator. If we want to find the <m>y</m>-coordinate for a particular <m>x</m>-value, we enter the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the desired point and press <c>ENTER</c>.</p>

<subsection><title>Constructing the Graph of a Function</title>
<p>Although some functions are defined by their graphs, we can also construct graphs for
functions described by tables or equations. We make these graphs the same way we graph
equations in two variables: by plotting points whose coordinates satisfy the equation.</p>
    
<example xml:id="example-graph-square-root">
<p>Graph the function <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x + 4}</m>.</p>
<solution>
    <p>Choose several convenient values for <m>x</m> and evaluate the function to find the corresponding <m>f(x)</m>-values. For this function we cannot choose <m>x</m>-values less than <m>−4</m>, because the square root of a negative number is not a real number. 
    <me>f(\alert{−4}) =\sqrt{\alert{−4} + 4}=\sqrt{0}= 0</me>
    <me>f(\alert{−3}) =\sqrt{\alert{−3} + 4}=\sqrt{1}= 1</me>
    <me>f(\alert{0}) =\sqrt{\alert{0} + 4}=\sqrt{4}=2</me>
    <me>f(\alert{2}) =\sqrt{\alert{2} + 4}=\sqrt{6}\approx 2.45</me>
    <me>f(\alert{5}) =\sqrt{\alert{5} + 4}=\sqrt{9}=3</me>
    The results are shown in the table.</p>

<subsection><title>The Vertical Line Test</title>
<p>In a function, two different outputs cannot be related to the same input. This restriction means that two different ordered pairs cannot have the same first coordinate. What does it mean for the graph of the function?</p>
<p>Consider the graph shown in <xref ref="fig-vertical-line-test" autoname="yes"/>a. Every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, so there is only one point on the graph for each <m>x</m>-value. This graph represents a function. In <xref ref="fig-vertical-line-test" autoname="yes"/>b, however, the line <m>x = 2</m> intersects the graph at two points, <m>(2, 1)</m> and <m>(2, 4)</m>. Two different <m>y</m>-values, <m>1</m> and <m>4</m>, are related to the same <m>x</m>-value, <m>2</m>. This graph cannot be the graph of a function.</p>

<figure xml:id="fig-vertical-line-test"><image source="images/fig-vertical-line-test" alt="vertical line test"  width="90%"  /><caption></caption></figure>

<p>We summarize these observations as follows.</p>

<assemblage><title>The Vertical Line Test</title><line></line>
<p>A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph in
at most one point.</p>

<solution><p>
    Graph (a) represents a function, because it passes the vertical line test. Graph (b) is not the graph of a function, because the vertical line at (for example) <m>x = 1</m> intersects the graph at two points. For graph (c), notice the break in the curve at <m>x = 2</m>: The solid dot at <m>(2, 1)</m> is the only point on the graph with <m>x = 2</m>; the open circle at <m>(2, 3)</m> indicates that <m>(2, 3)</m> is not a point on the graph. Thus, graph (c) is a function, with <m>f(2) = 1</m>.

<subsection><title>Graphical Solution of Equations and Inequalities</title>
    <p>The graph of an equation in two variables is just a picture of its solutions. When we read the coordinates of a point on the graph, we are reading a pair of <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values that make the equation true. </p>
    <sidebyside><paragraphs width="65%">
        <p>For example, the point <m>(2, 7)</m> lies on the graph of <m>y = 2x + 3</m> shown in <xref ref="fig-function-graph" autoname="yes"/> , so we know that the ordered pair <m>(2, 7)</m> is a solution of the equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m>. You can verify algebraically that <m>x = \alert{2}</m> and <m>y = \alert{7}</m> satisfy the equation: 
    <me>\text{Does }~\alert{7} = 2 (\alert{2}) + 3\text{? Yes}</me>
    We can also say that <m>x = 2</m> is a solution of the one-variable equation <m>2x + 3 = 7</m>. In fact, we can use the graph of <m>y = 2x + 3</m> to solve the equation <m>2x + 3 = k</m> for any value of <m>k</m>. Thus, we can use graphs to find solutions to equations in one variable.</p></paragraphs>

<solution>
    <figure xml:id="fig-graph-to-solve"><image source="images/fig-graph-to-solve" alt="function graph"  width="50%"  /><caption></caption></figure>
    <p>Begin by locating the point <m>P</m> on the graph for which <m>y = 150</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-graph-to-solve" autoname="yes"/>. Now find the <m>x</m>-coordinate of point <m>P</m> by drawing an imaginary line from <m>P</m> straight down to the <m>x</m>-axis. The <m>x</m>-coordinate of <m>P</m> is <m>x = 9</m>. Thus, <m>P</m> is the point <m>(9,150)</m>, and <m>x = 9</m> when <m>y = 150</m>. The solution of the equation <m>150 = 285 − 15x</m> is <m>x = 9</m>. You can verify the solution algebraically by substituting <m>x = \alert{9}</m> into the equation:</p> 
    <p>Does <m>150 = 285 − 15(\alert{9})</m>? </p>
    <me>285 − 15(\alert{9}) = 285 − 135 = 150. ~~\alert{Yes}</me>
</solution>
</example>

<p>The relationship between an equation and its graph is an important one. For the
previous example, make sure you understand that the following three statements are
equivalent:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The point <m>(9, 150)</m> lies on the graph of <m>y = 285 − 15x</m>.</li>
    <li>The ordered pair <m>(9, 150)</m> is a solution of the equation <m>y = 285 − 15x</m>.</li>

<sidebyside><p width="70%">In a similar fashion, we can solve inequalities with a graph. Consider again the graph of <m>y = 2x + 3</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-graph-to-solve3" autoname="yes"/>. We saw that <m>x = 2</m> is the solution of the equation <m>2x + 3 = 7</m>. When we use <m>x = 2</m> as the input for the function <m>f(x) = 2x + 3</m>, the output is <m>y = 7</m>. Which input values for <m>x</m> produce output values greater than <m>7</m>? You can see in <xref ref="fig-graph-to-solve3" autoname="yes"/> that <m>x</m>-values greater than <m>2</m> produce <m>y</m>-values greater than <m>7</m>, because points on the graph with <m>x</m>-values greater than <m>2</m> have <m>y</m>-values greater than <m>7</m>. Thus, the solutions of the inequality <m>2x + 3 \gt 7</m> are <m>x\gt 2</m>. You can verify this result by solving the inequality algebraically.</p>

    <p>Use the graph of <m>y = 285 − 15x</m> to solve the inequality <me>285 − 15x \gt 150</me></p>
<solution><p>
    We begin by locating the point <m>P</m> on the graph for which <m>y = 150</m> and <m>x = 9</m> (its <m>x</m>-coordinate). Now, because <m>y = 285 − 15x</m> for points on the graph, the inequality <m>285 − 15x \gt 150</m> is equivalent to <m>y \gt 150</m>. So we are looking for points on the graph with <m>y</m>-coordinate greater than <m>150</m>. These points are shown in <xref ref="fig-graph-to-solve-inequality" autoname="yes"/>. The <m>x</m>-coordinates of these points are the <m>x</m>-values that satisfy the inequality. From the graph, we see that the solutions are <m>x \lt 9</m>.

<p>We can also use this graphical technique to solve nonlinear equations and inequalities.</p>

<example xml:id="example-graph-to-solve-cubic">
    <p>Use a graph of <m>f(x) = −2x^3 + x^2 + 16x</m> to solve the equation 
    <me>−2x^3 + x^2 + 16x = 15</me></p>

<solution>
    <p>If we sketch in the horizontal line <m>y = 15</m>, we can see that there are three points on the graph of <m>f</m> that have <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>15</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-graph-to-solve-cubic" autoname="yes"/>. The <m>x</m>-coordinates of these points are the solutions of the equation </p>
    
        <p><me>−2x^3 + x^2 + 16x = 15</me>
    From the graph, we see that the solutions are <m>x = −3</m>, <m>x = 1</m>, and approximately <m>x = 2.5</m>. We can verify the solutions algebraically. For example, if <m>x = \alert{−3}</m>, we have 
    \begin{align*}
        f(\alert{−3})<ampersand />−2(\alert{−3})3 + (\alert{−3})^2 + 16(\alert{−3})<backslash /><backslash />
        <ampersand />= −2(−27) + 9 − 48<backslash /><backslash />
        <ampersand />=54 + 9 − 48 = 15  
    \end{align*}
    so <m>−3</m> is a solution.</p>

    and trace along the curve to the point <m>(2.4680851, 15.512401)</m>. We are close to a solution, because the <m>y</m>-value is close to <m>15</m>. Try entering <m>x</m>-values close to <m>2.4680851</m>, for instance, <m>x = 2.4</m> and <m>x = 2.5</m>, to find a better approximation for the solution.
