<title>Linear Functions</title>
<subsection><title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>   
<p>
    As we saw in <xref ref="LinMod" autoname="yes" />, many linear models <m>y = f (x)</m> have equations of the form
    <me>f (x) = (\text{starting value}) + (\text{rate of change}) \cdot x</me>
    The starting value, or the value of <m>y</m> at <m>x = 0</m>, is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. Thus, we can write the equation of a line as
    <me>f (x) = b + mx</me>
    where the constant term, <m>b</m>, is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the line, and <m>m</m>, the coefficient of <m>x</m>, is the slope of the line. This form for the equation of a line is called the <term index="yes">slope-intercept form</term>.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
        If we write the equation of a linear function in the form,
        <me>f (x) = b + mx</me>
        then <m>m</m> is the <term index="yes">slope</term> of the line, and <m>b</m> is the <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term>.
    </p>
</assemblage>
<p>
    (You may have encountered the slope-intercept equation in the equivalent form 
    <m>y = mx + b</m>.) For example, consider the two linear functions and their graphs shown in <xref ref="fig-decreasing-line" autoname="yes" /> and <xref ref="fig-increasing-line" autoname="yes"/>.

    We can see that the <m>y</m>-intercept of each line is given by the constant term, <m>b</m>. By examining the table of values, we can also see why the coefficient of <m>x</m>gives the slope of the line: 
    For <m>f (x)</m>, each time <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m> unit, <m>y</m> decreases by <m>3</m> units. For <m>g(x)</m>, each time <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m> unit, <m>y</m> increases by <m>2</m> units. For each graph, the coefficient of <m>x</m> is a scale factor that tells us how many units <m>y</m> changes for <m>1</m> unit increase in <m>x</m>. But that is exactly what the slope tells us about a line.

<example xml:id="example-internet-providers">
    <p>Francine is choosing an Internet service provider. She paid <dollar />30 for a modem, and she is considering three companies for dialup service: Juno charges <dollar />14.95 per month, ISP.com charges <dollar/>12.95 per month, and peoplepc charges <dollar />15.95 per month. Match the graphs in <xref ref="fig-internet-providers" autoname="yes"/> to Francine’s Internet cost with each company.</p>
    <solution>
        <p>Francine pays the same initial amount, <dollar />30 for the modem, under each plan. The monthly fee is the rate of change of her total cost, in dollars per month. </p>
    <sidebyside><p>We can write a formula for her cost under each plan.

    In the equation <m>f (x) = b + mx</m>, we call <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> <term index="yes">parameters</term>. Their values are fixed for any particular linear equation; for example, in the equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m>, <m>m = 2</m> and <m>b = 3</m>, and the variables are <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. By changing the values of <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>, we can write the equation for any line except a vertical line (see <xref ref="fig-slope-vs-intercept" autoname="yes"/>). The collection of all linear functions <m>f (x) = b + mx</m> is called a <term index="yes">two-parameter</term> family of functions.

<subsection><title>Slope-Intercept Method of Graphing</title>
<p>
    Look again at the lines in <xref ref="fig-slope-vs-intercept" autoname="yes"/>: There is only one line that has a given slope and passes through a particular point. That is, the values of <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> determine the particular line. The value of <m>b</m> gives us a starting point, and the value of <m>m</m> tells us which direction to go to plot a second point. Thus, we can graph a line given in slope-intercept form without having to make a table of values.
</p>

        <li>We see that the slope of the line is <m>m = \frac{4}{3}</m> and its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>b = −2</m>. We begin by plotting the <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>(0, −2)</m>. We then use the slope to find another point on the line. We have
        <me>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{4}{3}</me>
        so starting at <m>(0, −2)</m>, we move <m>4</m> units in the <m>y</m>-direction and <m>3</m> units in the <m>x</m>-direction, to arrive at the point <m>(3, 2)</m>. Finally, we draw the line through these two points. (See <xref ref="fig-slope-intercept" />.)</li>

<p>The slope of a line is a ratio and can be written in many equivalent ways. In <xref ref="example-slope-intercept" autoname="yes" />, the slope is equal to <m>\frac{8}{6}</m>, <m>\frac{12}{9}</m>, and <m>\frac{−4}{−3}</m>. We can use any of these fractions to locate a third
point on the line as a check. If we use <m>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \frac{−4}{−3}</m>, we move down <m>4</m> units and left <m>3</m> units from the <m>y</m>-intercept to find the point <m>(−3, −6)</m> on the line.</p>

<subsection><title>Finding a Linear Equation from a Graph</title>
    <p>
        We can also use the slope-intercept form to find the equation of a line from its graph. First, note the value of the <m>y</m>-intercept from the graph, and then calculate the slope using two convenient points.
    </p>

<example xml:id="example-lin-equation-from-graph">
    <p>Find an equation for the line shown in <xref ref="fig-lin-equation-from-graph" autoname="yes" />.</p>
    <solution>
        <sidebyside><p>
            The line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis at the point <m>(0, 3200)</m>, so the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>3200</m>. To calculate the slope of the line, locate another point, say <m>(20, 6000)</m>, and compute:
            \begin{align*}m <ampersand />= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
                = \frac{6000 − 3200}{20 − 0}<backslash/><backslash/>
                <ampersand/>=\frac{2800}{20}= 140
            \end{align*}
            The slope-intercept form of the equation, with <m>m = 140</m> and <m>b = 3200</m>, is <m>y = 3200 + 140x</m>.

<subsection><title>Point-Slope Form</title>
<sidebyside><figure xml:id="fig-point-slope"><image source="images/fig-point-slope" alt="point slope"  width="90%"  /><caption></caption></figure>
<p>
    We can find the equation for a line if we know its slope and <m>y</m>-intercept. What if we do not know the <m>y</m>-intercept, but instead know some other point on the line? There is only one line that passes through a given point and has a given slope. For example, we can graph the line of slope <m>\frac{−3}{4}</m> that passes through the point <m>(1, −4)</m>. </p></sidebyside>
    <p>We first plot the given point, <m>(1, −4)</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-point-slope" autoname="yes" />. Then we use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is
        <me>m =\frac{−3}{4}= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</me>
    so we move down <m>3</m> units and then <m>4</m> units to the right, starting from <m>(1, −4)</m>. This brings us to the point <m>(5, −7)</m>. We can then draw the line through these two points.</p>
    <p>We can also find an equation for the line, as shown in Example 4.</p>

<example xml:id="example-point-slope">
    <p>Find an equation for the line that passes through <m>(1, −4)</m> and has slope <m>\frac{−3}{4}</m>.</p>
<solution>We will use the formula for slope,
    <me>m = \frac{y_2 − y_1}{x_2 − x_1}</me>
    We substitute <m>\frac{−3}{4}</m> for the slope, <m>m</m>, and <m>(1, −4)</m> for <m>(x_1, y_1)</m>. For the second point, <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>, we will use the variable point <m>(x, y)</m>. Substituting these values into the slope formula gives us
    <me>\frac{−3}{4}= \frac{y − (−4)}{x − 1}=\frac{y + 4}{x − 1}</me>
    To solve for <m>y</m> we first multiply both sides by <m>x − 1</m>.
    \begin{align*}
                \alert{(x-1)}\frac{−3}{4}<ampersand />
                =\frac{y +4}{x − 1}\alert{(x-1)} <ampersand /><ampersand /><backslash /><backslash />

                \frac{−3}{4}x-\frac{13}{4}<ampersand />=y <ampersand /><ampersand /> \frac{3}{4}-4=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{16}{4}=\frac{-13}{4}
    \end{align*}
</solution></example>

<p>
    When we use the slope formula in this way to find the equation of a line, we substitute a variable point <m>(x, y)</m> for the second point. This version of the formula, 
    <me>m = \frac{y − y_1}{x − x_1}</me>
    is called the <term index="yes">point-slope form</term> for a linear equation. It is sometimes stated in another form obtained by clearing the fraction to get
    \begin{align*}
                \alert{(x−x_1)}m<ampersand />
                =\frac{y -y_1}{x − x_1}\alert{(x−x_1)} <ampersand /><ampersand />
                \text{Multiply both sides by }(x − x_1)<backslash /><backslash />
