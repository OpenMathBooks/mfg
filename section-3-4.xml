<subsection><title>Powers of the Form <m>a^{m/n}</m></title>
<p>
    In the last section, we considered powers of the form <m>a^{1/n}</m>, such as <m>x^{1/3}</m> and <m>x^{âˆ’1/4}</m>, and saw that <m>a^{1/n}</m> is equivalent to the root <m>\sqrt[n]{a}</m>. What about other fractional exponents? What meaning can we attach to a power of the form <m>a^{m /n}</m>?
</p>
<p>
    Consider the power <m>x^{3/2}</m>. Notice that the exponent <m>\frac{3}{2}= 3(\frac{1}{2})</m>, and thus by the third law of exponents, we can write
    <me>(x^{1/2})3 = x^{(1/2)^3} = x^{3/2}</me>
    In other words, we can compute <m>x^{3/2}</m> by first taking the square root of <m>x</m> and then cubing the result. For example,
    \begin{align*}
        100^{3/2} \amp = (\alert{100^{1/2}})3 \amp\amp \text{Take the square root of 100.}\\
        \amp= \alert{10^3} = 1000  \amp\amp \text{Cube the result.}
    \end{align*}
    We will define fractional powers only when the base is a positive number.
