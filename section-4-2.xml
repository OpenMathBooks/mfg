<title>Exponential Functions</title>

<p>
	In <xref ref="Exponential-Growth-and-Decay" autoname="yes"/>, we studied functions that describe exponential growth or decay. More formally, we define an <term>exponential function</term> as follows,
</p>
<assemblage><title>Exponential Function</title>
<p>
	<me>f(x) = ab^x \text{, where } b \gt 0 \text{ and } b \ne 1 \text{, } a \ne 0</me>
</p></assemblage>
<p>
	Some examples of exponential functions are
	<me>f (x) = 5^x \text{, } P(t) = 250(1.7)^t \text{, and } g(n) = 2.4(0.3)^n</me>
	The constant <m>a</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph because
	<me>f (0) = a \cdot b^0 = a \cdot 1 = a</me>
	For the examples above, we find that the <m>y</m>-intercepts are
	\begin{align*}
	f(0) \amp= 5^0 = 1 \text{,} \\
	P(0) \amp= 250(1.7)^0 = 250\text{, and} \\
	g(0) \amp= 2.4(0.3)^0 = 2.4
	\end{align*}
</p>
<p>
	The positive constant <m>b</m> is called the <term>base</term> of the exponential function. We do not allow <m>b</m> to be negative, because if <m>b \lt 0</m>, then <m>b^x</m> is not a real number for some values of <m>x</m>. For example, if <m>b = -4</m> and <m>f (x) = (-4)^x</m>, then <m>f (1/2) = (-4)^{1/2}</m> is an imaginary number. We also exclude <m>b = 1</m> as a base because <m>1^x = 1</m> for all values of <m>x</m>; hence the function <m>f (x) = 1^x</m> is actually the constant function <m>f (x) = 1</m>.
</p>

<subsection><title>Graphs of Exponential Functions</title>
<p>
    The graphs of exponential functions have two characteristic shapes, depending on whether the base, <m>b</m>, is greater than <m>1</m> or less than <m>1</m>. As typical examples, consider the graphs of <m>f (x) = 2^x</m> and <m>g(x) =\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x</m> shown in <xref ref="fig-exponential-growth-and-decay" autoname="yes"/>. Some values for <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are recorded in <xref ref="table-exp-growth" >Tables</xref> and <xref ref="table-exp-decay" autoname="no"/>

<p>
	Notice that <m>f (x) = 2^x</m> is an increasing function and <m>g(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x</m> is a decreasing function. Both are concave up. In general, exponential functions have the following properties.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Properties of Exponential Functions, <m>f(x) = ab^x</m>, <m>a \gt 0</m></title><p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Domain: all real numbers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Range: all positive numbers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>If <m>b \gt 1</m>, the function is increasing and concave up;</p> 
		<p>if <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>, the function is decreasing and concave up.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0, a)</m>. There is no <m>x</m>-intercept.</p>
	</li>
</ol></p>
</assemblage>

<p>
	In <xref ref="table-exp-growth" autoname="yes"/> you can see that as the <m>x</m>-values decrease toward negative infinity, the corresponding <m>y</m>-values decrease toward zero. As a result, the graph of <m>f</m> decreases toward the <m>x</m>-axis as we move to the left. Thus, the negative <m>x</m>-axis is a horizontal asymptote for exponential functions with <m>b \gt 1</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-exponential-growth-and-decay" autoname="yes"/>a. For exponential functions with <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>, the positive <m>x</m>-axis is an asymptote, as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-exponential-growth-and-decay" autoname="yes"/>b. (See <xref ref="basic-functions" autoname="yes"/> to review asymptotes.)
</p>
<p>
	In <xref ref="example-two-exponential-growth" autoname="yes"/>, we compare two increasing exponential functions. The larger the value of the base, <m>b</m>, the faster the function grows. In this example, both functions have <m>a = 1</m>.
</p>
<example xml:id="example-two-exponential-growth">
<p>
	Compare the graphs of <m>f (x) = 3^x</m> and <m>g(x) = 4^x</m>.
</p>
<solution><p>
	Evaluate each function for several convenient values, as shown in <xref ref="table-two-exponential-growth" autoname="yes"/>.
</p>
<p>
	Plot the points for each function and connect them with smooth curves. For positive <m>x</m>-values, <m>g(x)</m> is always larger than <m>f (x)</m>, and is increasing more rapidly. In <xref ref="fig-two-exponential-growth" autoname="yes"/>, <m>g(x) = 4^x</m> climbs more rapidly than <m>f (x) = 3^x</m>. Both graphs cross the <m>y</m>-axis at (0, 1).

<subsection><title>Transformations of Exponential Functions</title>
<p>
	In <xref ref="chap2" autoname="yes"/>, we considered transformations of the basic graphs. For instance, the graphs of the functions <m>y = x^2 - 4</m> and <m>y = (x - 4)^2</m> are shifts of the basic parabola, <m>y = x^2</m>. In a similar way, we can shift or stretch the graph of an exponential function while the basic shape is preserved.
</p>
<example xml:id="example-GC-shift-exponentials">
<p>
	Use your calculator to graph the following functions. Describe how these graphs compare with the graph of <m>h(x) = 2^x</m>.

		The graph of <m>f(x) = 2^x + 3</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-exponential-growth" autoname="yes"/>b, has the same basic shape as that of <m>h(x) = 2^x</m>, but it has a horizontal asymptote at <m>y = 3</m> instead of at <m>y = 0</m> (the <m>x</m>-axis). In fact, <m>f(x) = h(x) + 3</m>, so the graph of <m>f</m> is a vertical translation of the graph of <m>h</m> by <m>3</m> units. If every point on the graph of <m>h(x) = 2^x</m> is moved <m>3</m> units upward, the result is the graph of <m>f (x) = 2^x + 3</m>.

	The graph of <m>g</m> is the reflection of the graph of <m>f</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis. We can see why this is true by writing the formula for <m>g(x)</m> in another way:
	<me>g(x) =\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x= \left(2^{-1}\right)^x = 2^{-x}</me>
	We see that <m>g(x)</m> is the same function as <m>f (-x)</m>. Replacing <m>x</m> by <m>-x</m> in the formula for a function switches every point <m>( p, q)</m> on the graph with the point <m>(-p, q)</m> and thus reflects the graph about the <m>y</m>-axis.

	First, compare the values for these two functions in <xref ref="table-power-vs-exponential" autoname="yes"/>.

<p>
	As you would expect, the graphs of the two functions are also quite different. For starters, note that the power function goes through the origin, while the exponential function has <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0, 2)</m>. (See <xref ref="fig-power-vs-exponential-1" autoname="yes"/>) From the table, we see that <m>h(3) = f(3) = 54</m>, so the two graphs intersect at <m>x = 3</m>. (They also intersect at approximately <m>x = 2.48</m>.) However, if you compare the values of <m>h(x) = 2x^3</m> and <m>f(x) = 2(3^x)</m> for larger values of <m>x</m>, you will see that eventually the exponential function overtakes the power function, as shown in <xref ref="fig-power-vs-exponential-2" autoname="yes"/>.

<subsection><title>Exponential Equations</title>
<p>
	An <term index="yes">exponential equation</term> is one in which the variable is part of an exponent. For example, the equation
	<me>3^x = 81</me>
	is exponential. Many exponential equations can be solved by writing both sides of the equation as powers with the same base. To solve the above equation, we write
	<me>3^x = 3^4</me>
	which is true if and only if <m>x = 4</m>. In general, if two equivalent powers have the same base, then their exponents must be equal also, as long as the base is not <m>0</m> or <m>\pm 1</m>.
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes the laws of exponents can be used to express both sides of an equation as single powers of a common base.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-exponential-equations">
<p>
	Solve the following equations.
	<ol label="a">
		<li><m>3^{x-2} = 9^3</m></li>
		<li><m> 27 \cdot 3^{-2x} = 9^{x+1}</m></li>
	</ol>
</p>
<solution>
<ol label="a">
	<li>
		Using the fact that <m>9 = 3^2</m>, write each side of the equation as a power of <m>3</m>:
		\begin{align*}
		3^{x-2} \amp = \left(3^2\right)^3 \\
		3^{x-2} \amp = 3^6 
		\end{align*}
		Now equate the exponents to obtain
		\begin{align*}
		x - 2 \amp = 6 \\
		x  \amp = 8
		\end{align*}
	</li>
	<li>
		Write each factor as a power of <m>3</m>.
		<me>3^3 \cdot 3^{-2x} = \left(3^2\right)^{x+1}</me>
		Use the laws of exponents to simplify each side:
		<me>3^{3-2x} = 3^{2x+2}</me>
		Now equate the exponents to obtain
		\begin{align*}
		3 - 2x \amp = 2x + 2 \\
		-4x =\amp  -1
		\end{align*}
		The solution is <m>x = \frac{1}{4}</m>.

	</p>
<solution>
<p>
	Let <m>P</m> represent the number of fleas present after <m>t</m> days. The original population of <m>10</m> is multiplied by a factor of <m>2</m> every <m>5</m> days, or
	<me>P(t) = 10 \cdot 2^{t/5}</me>
	Set <m>P = \alert{10,240}</m> and solve for <m>t</m>:
	\begin{align*}
	\alert{10,240} \amp = 10\cdot 2^{t/5}\amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by 10.} \\
	1024 \amp = 2^{t/5} \amp\amp \text {Write 1024 as a power of 2.} \\
	2^{10} \amp = 2^{t/5}
	\end{align*}
	Equate the exponents to get <m>10 = \frac{t}{5}</m>, or <m>t = 50</m>. The population will grow to <m>10,240</m> fleas in <m>50</m> days.

<subsection><title>Graphical Solution of Exponential Equations</title>
<p>
	It is not always so easy to express both sides of the equation as powers of the same base. In the following sections, we will develop more general methods for finding exact solutions to exponential equations. But we can use a graphing calculator to obtain approximate solutions.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-gc-exponential-equation">
<p>
	Use the graph of <m>y = 2^x</m> to find an approximate solution to the equation <m>2^x = 5</m> accurate to the nearest hundredth.
</p>
<solution>
<p>
	Enter <m>Y_1 = 2</m> <c>^</c> X and use the standard graphing window (<c>ZOOM</c> 6) to obtain the graph shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-exponential-equation" autoname="yes"/>a. We are looking for a point on this graph with <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>5</m>. Using the TRACE feature, we see that the <m>y</m>-coordinates are too small when <m>x \lt 2.1</m> and too large when <m>x \gt 2.4</m>. 
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-GC-exponential-equation"><image source="images/fig-GC-exponential-equation" alt="two GC displays of exponential function" width="100%"/><caption></caption></figure>
<p>
	The solution we want lies somewhere between <m>x = 2.1</m> and <m>x = 2.4</m>, but this approximation is not accurate enough. To improve our approximation, we will use the <term index="yes">intersect</term> feature. Set <m>Y_2 = 5</m> and press <c>GRAPH</c>. The <m>x</m>-coordinate of the intersection point of the two graphs is the solution of the equation <m>2^x = 5</m> Activating the <term>intersect</term> command results in <xref ref="fig-GC-exponential-equation" autoname="yes"/>b, and we see that, to the nearest hundredth, the solution is <m>2.32</m>.
</p>
<p>
	We can verify that our estimate is reasonable by substituting into the equation:
	<me>2^{2.32}  \stackrel{?}{=} 5</me>
	We enter 2 <c>^</c> 2.32 <c>ENTER</c> to get <m>4.993322196</m>. This number is not equal to <m>5</m>, but it is close, so we believe that <m>x = 2.32</m> is a reasonable approximation to the solution of the equation <m>2^x = 5</m>.
</p>
 </solution>
</example>

<exercise xml:id="exercise-GC-exponential-equation"><statement>
	Use the graph of <m>y = 5^x</m> to find an approximate solution to <m>5^x = 285</m>, accurate to two decimal places.
