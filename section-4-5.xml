<subsection><title>Fitting an Exponential Function through Two Points</title>
<p>
	To write a formula for an exponential function, we need to know the initial value, <m>a</m>, and the growth or decay factor, <m>b</m>. We can find these two parameters if we know any two function values.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-fit-exponential">
<p>
	Find an exponential function that has the values <m>f (2) = 4.5</m> and <m>f (5) = 121.5</m>.
</p>
<solution>
<p>
	We would like to find values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> so that the given function values satisfy <m>f (x) = ab^x</m> . By substituting the function values into the formula, we can write two equations.
	\begin{align*}
	f (2) \amp= 4.5 \text{ means }x = 2, y = 4.5, \amp\amp\text{so ab^2 = 4.5}\\
	f (5) \amp= 121.5 \text{ means }x = 5, y = 121.5, \amp\amp\text{so ab^5 = 121.5}
	\end{align*}
	This is a system of equations in the two unknowns, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, but it is not a linear system. We can solve the system by the method of elimination, but we will divide one of the equations by the other.
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{ab^5}{ab^2}\amp= \frac{121.5}{4.5}\\
	b^3 \amp = 27
	\end{align*}
	Note that by dividing the two equations, we eliminated <m>a</m>, and we can now solve for <m>b</m>.
	\begin{align*}
	b^3 \amp = 27 \\
	b \amp = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3
	\end{align*}
	Next we substitute <m>b = 3</m> into either of the two equations and solve for <m><m>a</m>.
	\begin{align*}
	a(3)^2 \amp = 4.5 \\
	a \align= \frac{4.5}{9} \\
	\amp = 0.5
	\end{align*}
	Thus, <m>a = 0.5</m> and <m>b = 3</m>, so the function is <m>f (x) = 0.5(3^ x )</m>.
