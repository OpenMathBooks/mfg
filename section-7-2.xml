<title>Graphing Polynomial Functions</title>

<p>
	In <xref ref="Polynomial-Functions" autoname="yes"/>, we considered applications of polynomial functions. Although most applications use only a portion of the graph of a particular polynomial, we can learn a lot about these functions by taking a more global view of their behavior.
</p>

<subsection><title>Classifying Polynomials by Degree</title>
<p>
	The graph of a polynomial function depends first of all on its degree. We have already studied the graphs of polynomials of degrees <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, and <m>2</m>. A polynomial of degree <m>0</m> is a constant, and its graph is a horizontal line. An example of such a polynomial function is <m>f(x) = 3</m> (see <xref ref="fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials" autoname="yes"/>a). A polynomial of degree <m>1</m> is a linear function, and its graph is a straight line. The function <m>f(x) = 2x − 3</m> is an example of a polynomial of degree <m>1</m>. (See <xref ref="fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials" autoname="yes"/>b.)
	<figure xml:id="fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials"><image source="images/fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials" alt="horizontal line and line of nonzero slope"/><caption></caption></figure>
</p>
<p>
	Quadratic functions, such as <m>f(x) = −2x^2 + 6x + 8</m>, are polynomials of degree <m>2</m>. The graph of every quadratic function is a parabola, with the same basic shape as the standard parabola, <m>y = x^2</m>. (See <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas2" autoname="yes"/>.) It has one turning point, where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. The turning point of a parabola is the same as its vertex.

</p>

</subsection>




<subsection><title>Cubic Polynomials</title>

<p>
	Do the graphs of all <term index="yes">cubic</term>, or third-degree, polynomials have a basic shape in common? We can graph a few examples and find out. Unlike the basic parabola, the graph of <m>y = x^3</m> is always increasing. At the origin, however, it changes from concave down to concave up. A point where the graph changes concavity is called an <term index="yes">inflection point</term>.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-two-cubics">
	<p>
		Graph the cubic polynomial <m>P(x) = x^3 − 4x</m> and compare its graph with that of the basic cubic, <m>y = x^3</m>.
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		The graph of the basic cubic is shown in <xref ref="fig-two-cubics" autoname="yes"/>a. To help us understand the graph of the polynomial <m>P(x) = x^3 − 4x</m>, we will evaluate the function to make a table of values. We can do this by hand or use the Table feature on the graphing calculator.

		The graph of <m>P(x) = x^3 − 4x</m> is shown in <xref ref="fig-two-cubics" autoname="yes"/>b. It is not exactly the same shape as the basic cubic—it has two turning points—but it is similar, especially at the edges of the graphs.
	</p>
</solution></example>

<p>
	Despite the differences in the central portions of the two graphs, they exhibit similar <em>long-term</em> behavior. For very large and very small values of <m>x</m>, both graphs look like the power function <m>y = x^3</m>. The <m>y</m>-values increase from <m>-\infty</m> toward zero in the third quadrant, and they increase from zero toward <m>+\infty</m> in the first quadrant. Or we might say that the graphs start at the lower left and extend to the upper right. All cubic polynomials display this behavior when their lead coefficients (the coefficient of the <m>x^3</m> term) are positive.
</p>
<p>
	Both of the graphs in <xref ref="example-two-cubics"/> are smooth curves without any breaks or holes. This smoothness is a feature of the graphs of all polynomial functions. The domain of any polynomial function is the entire set of real numbers.

<p>
	Another way to describe the long-term behavior of a polynomial graph is to note that for large values of <m>\abs{x}</m>, the shape is similar to a power function of the same degree. It is the presence of the lower-degree terms in the polynomial that are responsible for any extra wiggles or turning points in the graph.

<subsection><title><m>x</m>-Intercepts and the Factor Theorem</title>
<p>
	In <xref ref="chap6" autoname="yes"/>, we saw that the x-intercepts of a quadratic polynomial, <m>f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m>, occur at values of <m>x</m> for which <m>f(x) = 0</m>, that is, at the real-valued solutions of the equation <m>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</m>. The same holds true for polynomials of higher degree.
</p>
<p>
	Solutions of the equation <m>P(x) = 0</m> are called <term>zeros</term> of the polynomial <m>P</m>. In <xref ref="example-two-cubics" autoname="yes"/>, we graphed the cubic polynomial <m>P(x) = x^3 − 4x</m>. Its <m>x</m>-intercepts are the solutions of the equation <m>x^3 − 4x = 0</m>, which we can solve by factoring the polynomial <m>P(x)</m>.
	<md>
		<mrow>
			x^3 − 4x \amp= 0
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			x(x − 2)(x + 2) \amp= 0
		</mrow>
	</md>
	The zeros of <m>P</m> are <m>0</m>, <m>2</m>, and <m>−2</m>. Each zero of <m>P</m> corresponds to a factor of <m>P(x)</m>. This result suggests the following theorem, which holds for any polynomial <m>P</m>.
</p>

<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-factor-theorem"><title>Factor Theorem</title>
<p>
	Let <m>P(x)</m> be a polynomial with real number coefficients. Then <m>(x − a)</m> is a factor of <m>P(x)</m> if and only if <m>P(a) = 0</m>.
</p></assemblage>

<p>
	The factor theorem follows from the division algorithm for polynomials. We will consider both of these results in more detail in the Homework problems.
</p>
<p>
	Because a polynomial function of degree <m>n</m> can have at most <m>n</m> linear factors of the form <m>(x − a)</m>, it follows that <m>P</m> can have at most <m>n</m> distinct zeros. Another way of saying this is that if <m>P(x)</m> is a polynomial of <m>n</m>th degree, the equation <m>P(x) = 0</m> can have at most <m>n</m> distinct solutions, some of which may be complex numbers. (We consider complex numbers in <xref ref="Complex-Numbers" autoname="yes"/>.) Because only real-valued solutions appear on the graph as <m>x</m>-intercepts, we have the following corollary to the factor theorem.
</p>

<assemblage><title><m>x</m>-Intercepts of Polynomials</title>
<p>
	A polynomial of degree <m>n</m> can have at most <m>n</m> <m>x</m>-intercepts.
</p></assemblage>

<p>
	If some of the zeros of <m>P</m> are complex numbers, they will not appear on the graph, so a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> <em>may have fewer</em> than <m>n</m> <m>x</m>-intercepts.

<subsection><title>Zeros of Multiplicity Two or Three</title>
<p>
	The appearance of the graph near an <m>x</m>-intercept is determined by the multiplicity of the zero there. For example, both real zeros of the polynomial <m>g(x) = x^4 − 3x^2 − 4</m> in <xref ref="example-cubic-and-quartic" autoname="yes"/>b are of multiplicity one, and the graph crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at each intercept. However, the polynomial <m>f(x) = x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x</m> in <xref ref="example-cubic-and-quartic" autoname="yes"/>a has a zero of multiplicity two at <m>x = −3</m>. The graph of <m>f</m> just touches the <m>x</m>-axis and then reverses direction without crossing the axis.
</p>
<p>
	To understand what happens in general, compare the graphs of the three polynomials in <xref ref="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" autoname="yes"/>.
	<figure xml:id="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero"><image source="images/fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" alt="plots of a linear, quadratic, and cubic, each with a single zero"/><caption></caption></figure>
	<ol label="*1*">
		<li><p>
			In <xref ref="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" autoname="yes"/>a, <m>L(x) = x − 2</m> has a zero <em>of multiplicity one</em> at <m>x = 2</m>, and its graph crosses the <m>x</m>-axis there.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			In <xref ref="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" autoname="yes"/>b, <m>Q(x) = (x − 2)^2</m> has a zero <em>of multiplicity two</em> at <m>x = 2</m>, and its graph touches the <m>x</m>-axis there but changes direction without crossing.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			In <xref ref="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" autoname="yes"/>c, <m>C(x) = (x − 2)^3</m> has a zero <em>of multiplicity three</em> at <m>x = 2</m>. In this case, the graph makes an S-shaped curve at the intercept, like the graph of <m>y = x^3</m>.

<p>
	Near its <m>x</m>-intercepts, the graph of a polynomial takes one of the characteristic shapes illustrated in <xref ref="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" autoname="yes"/>. (Although we will not consider zeros of multiplicity greater than three, they correspond to similar behavior in the graph: At a zero of odd multiplicity, the graph has an inflection point at the intercept; its graph makes an S-shaped curve. At a zero of even multiplicity, the graph has a turning point; it changes direction without crossing the <m>x</m>-axis.)
</p>

<example>
	<p>
		Graph the polynomial
		<me>
			f(x) = (x + 2)^3(x − 1)(x − 3)^2
		</me>
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		The polynomial has degree six, an even number, so its graph starts at the upper left and extends to the upper right. Its <m>y</m>-intercept is 
		<me>f(0) = (2)^3(−1)(−3)^2 = −72</me> 
		<m>f</m> has a zero of multiplicity three at <m>x = −2</m>, a zero of multiplicity one at <m>x = 1</m>, and a zero of multiplicity two at <m>x = 3</m>. The graph has an S-shaped curve at <m>x = −2</m>, crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>x = 1</m>, touches the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>x = 3</m>, and then changes direction, as shown in <xref ref="fig-sixth-degree-polynomial" autoname="yes"/>.
