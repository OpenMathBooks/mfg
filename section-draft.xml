<subsection><title>Solving Inequalities Graphically</title>
<p>
	In <xref ref="linear-regression" autoname="yes"/>, we used linear regression to fit a line to a collection of data points. If the data points do not cluster around a line, it does not make sense to describe them by a linear function. Compare the scatterplots in <xref ref="fig-nonlinear-regression" autoname="yes"/>. The points in <xref ref="fig-nonlinear-regression" autoname="yes"/>a are roughly linear in appearance, but the points in <xref ref="fig-nonlinear-regression" autoname="yes"/>b are not. However, we can visualize a parabola that would approximate the data we will. In this section, we will see how to fit a quadratic function to a collection of data points.

	We will need to solve a special type of <m>3 \times 3</m> linear system, that is, a linear system of three equations in three variables. We can solve these systems using the <term index="yes">elimination</term> method.
