<title>Solving Quadratic Equations</title>

<p>
	Not every quadratic equation can be solved by factoring or by extraction of roots. For example, the expression <m>x^2 + x − 1</m> cannot be factored, so the equation <m>x^2 + x − 1 = 0</m> cannot be solved by factoring. For other equations, factoring may be difficult. In this section we learn two methods that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.
</p>


<subsection><title>Squares of Binomials</title>
<p>
	In <xref ref="nonlinear-models" autoname="yes"/> we used extraction of roots to solve equations of the form 
	<me>a( px + q)^2 + r = 0</me>
	where the left side of the equation includes the square of a binomial, or a <term index="yes">perfect square</term>. We can write any quadratic equation in this form by completing the square.
</p>
<p>
	Consider the following squares of binomials.
</p>

<table><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">
    <row bottom="major">
        <cell>Square of binomial <m>(x+p)^2</m></cell>
        <cell><m>p</m></cell>
        <cell><m>2p</m></cell>
        <cell><m>p^2</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
        <cell>1.  <m>(x+\alert{5})^2=x^2+10x+25</m></cell>
        <cell><m>\alert{5}</m></cell>
        <cell><m>2(\alert{5})=10</m></cell>
        <cell><m>\alert{5}^2=25</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
        <cell>2.  <m>(x\alert{{}-{}3})^2=x^2-6x+9</m></cell>
        <cell><m>\alert{-3}</m></cell>
        <cell><m>2(\alert{-3})=-6</m></cell>
        <cell><m>\alert{-3}^2=9</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
        <cell>3.  <m>(x\alert{{}-{}12})^2=x^2-24x+144</m></cell>
        <cell><m>\alert{-12}</m></cell>
        <cell><m>2(\alert{-12})=-24</m></cell>
        <cell><m>\alert{-12}^2=144</m></cell>
    </row>
</tabular></table>

<p>
	In each case, the square of the binomial is a quadratic trinomial,
	<me>(x + p)^2= x^2 + 2px + p^2</me>
	The coefficient of the linear term, <m>2p</m>, is twice the constant in the binomial, and the constant term of the trinomial, <m>p^2</m>, is its square.
</p>
<p>
	We would like to reverse the process and write a quadratic expression as the square of a binomial. For example, what constant term can we add to
	<me>x^2 − 16x</me>
	to produce a perfect square trinomial? Compare the expression to the formula above:
	<me>
		\begin{alignedat}{4}
		x^2 \amp {}+{} \amp 2px \amp {}+{} \amp p^2 \amp {}={} \amp (x + p)^2 \\
		x^2 \amp {}-{} \amp 16x \amp {}+{} \amp \text{?} \amp {}={} \amp (x + \text{?})^2 \\
		\end{alignedat}
	</me>
	We see that <m>2p = −16</m>, so <m>p = \frac{1}{2}(−16) = −8</m>, and <m>p^2 = (−8)^2 = 64</m>. Substitute these values for <m>p^2</m> and <m>p</m> into the equation to find
	<me>x^2 − 16x + 64 = (x − 8)^2</me>
	Notice that in the resulting trinomial, the constant term is equal to <em>the square of one-half the coefficient of</em> <m>x</m>. In other words, we can find the constant term by taking one-half the coefficient of <m>x</m> and then squaring the result. Adding a constant term obtained in this way is called <term index="yes">completing the square</term>.
</p>

<example>
	<p>
		Complete the square by adding an appropriate constant; write the result as the square of a binomial.
		<ol label="*a*">
			<li>
				<m>x^2 − 12x + {}</m><fillin characters="6" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<m>x^2 + 5x + {}</m><fillin characters="6" />
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
<solution>
	<p><ol label="*a*">
		<li>
			One-half of <m>−12</m> is <m>−6</m>, so the constant term is <m>(−6)^2</m>, or <m>36</m>. Add <m>36</m> to obtain
			<me>x^2 − 12x \alert{{}+{}36}=(x − 6)^2~~~~~~~  \underset{p^2 = (−6)^2 = 36}{\stackrel {p = \frac{1}{2}(−12) = −6}{}}</me>
			
		</li>
		<li>
			One-half of <m>5</m> is <m>\frac{5}{2}</m>, so the constant term is <m>\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2</m>, or <m>\frac{25}{4}</m>. Add <m>\frac{25}{4}</m> to obtain
			<me>x^2 +5x \alert{{}+{}\frac{25}{4}}=\left(x +\frac{5}{2}\right)^2~~~~~~~  \underset{p^2 = (\frac{5}{2})^2 = \frac{25}{4}}{\stackrel {p = \frac{1}{2}(5) = \frac{5}{2}}{}}</me>
		</li></ol>
	</p>
</solution></example>

<p>
	You may find it helpful to visualize completing the square geometrically. We can think of the expression <m>x^2 + 2px</m> as the area of a rectangle with dimensions <m>x</m> and <m>x + 2p</m>. For example, the rectangle with length <m>x + 10</m> and width <m>x</m> has area <m>x(x + 10) = x^2 + 10x</m>, as shown in Figure 6.6a. We would like to cut the rectangle into pieces and rearrange them so that we can make a square. In Figure 6.6b, we move half of the x-term so that each side of the square has length x + 5 (note that p = 12 (10) = 5), and in Figure 6.6c we see that the missing corner piece has area p2 = 52 = 25.
