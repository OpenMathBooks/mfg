<title>Linear Programming</title>

<p>
	The term <term index="yes">linear programming</term> was coined in the late 1940s. It describes a relatively young branch of mathematics, compared to subjects such as Euclidean geometry, where the major ideas were already well understood 23 centuries ago. (The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote what can be considered the first geometry textbook about 300 B.C.) Business managers routinely solve linear programming problems for purchasing and marketing strategy, so it is possible that linear programming affects your daily life as much as any other branch of mathematics.

<subsection><title>The Objective Function and Constraints</title>
<p>
	TrailGear would like to maximize its profit from selling hiking boots. The company produces two kinds of hiking boots, a Weekender model, on which it makes <m>\$8</m> profit per pair, and a Sierra model, on which it makes <m>\$10</m> profit per pair. How many of each model should TrailGear produce each week in order to maximize its profit?
</p>
<p>
	If we let <m>x</m> represent the number of Weekender boots and <m>y</m> the number of Sierra boots TrailGear produces, then the total weekly profit is given by
	<me>P = 8x + 10y</me>
	This expression for <m>P</m> is called the <term index="yes">objective function</term>. The goal of a linear programming problem is to maximize or minimize such an objective function, subject to one or more constraints.
