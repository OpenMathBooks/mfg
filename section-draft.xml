<title>Quadratic Inequalities</title>

<subsection><title>Solving Inequalities Graphically</title>
<p>
	In <xref ref="chap1" autoname="yes"/>, we used graphs to solve equations and inequalities. The graphing technique is especially helpful for solving quadratic inequalities.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-fireworks">
	<p>
		The Chamber of Commerce in River City plans to put on a Fourth of July fireworks display. City regulations require that fireworks at public gatherings explode higher than <m>800</m> feet above the ground. The mayor particularly wants to include the Freedom Starburst model, which is launched from the ground. Its height after t seconds is given by
		<me>h = 256t − 16t^2</me>
		When should the Starburst explode in order to satisfy the safety regulation?
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		We can get an approximate answer to this question by looking at the graph of the rocket's height, shown in <xref ref="fig-fireworks" autoname="yes"/>.
		<figure xml:id="fig-fireworks"><image source="images/fig-fireworks" alt="graph of fireworks height" width="60%"/><caption></caption> </figure>
		When is the rocket's height greater than 800 feet, or, in mathematical terms, for what values of <m>t</m> is <m>h \gt 800</m>? The answer to this question is the solution of the inequality
		<me>256t − 16t^2 \gt 800</me>
	</p>
</solution>
